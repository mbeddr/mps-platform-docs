This website collects practical knowledge about MPS and popular MPS platforms. It's written mainly in the form of a Q&A.
It contains questions and answers for {{ mps() }} and the following platforms:

- {{ mps_extensions() }} [:material-help-box:](https://jetbrains.github.io/MPS-extensions/)
- {{ mbeddr() }} [[mps_utils|:material-help-box:]][:material-help-box:](https://github.com/mbeddr?type=source#documentation)
- {{ iets3() }} [:material-help-box:](https://voelter.de/data/books/kernelf-designEvoUse.pdf)

Click on one of the :material-help-box: buttons to go directly to the corresponding documentation.

You can open links starting with http://127.0.0.1 with the built-in [HTTP support plugin](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/mps/http-support-plugin.html).
Platform-specific instructions are indicated with an icon when possible. Long answers are collapsed by default. Questions marked with
:fontawesome-solid-flask: have answers that are educated guesses that are not confirmed.

If you have any suggestions, please write a comment at the bottom of the page or open an issue on GitHub.

- MPS versions: {{ mps_minimum }} -- {{ mps_maximum }} (the documentation is most of the time still true for newer versions)
