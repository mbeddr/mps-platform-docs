!!! question "How do accessory models and utility models differ in terms of dependencies?"

    Utility models are models of a language that don’t have one of the names reserved for the aspects. There is nothing special about them regarding dependencies.
    Accessory models are automatically part of the “imported models” if you add the language to the “used languages”.
