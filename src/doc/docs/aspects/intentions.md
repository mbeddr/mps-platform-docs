!!! question "How to can you go to the declaration of an intention when you open the intention menu?"
    
    Select the intention and click the arrow/press right arrow key --> `Go to intention declaration`.

!!! question "How do you execute an action as an intention?"

    Add the action to the action group [ActionsAsIntentions](http://127.0.0.1:63320/node?ref=r%3A9832fb5f-2578-4b58-8014-a5de79da988e%28jetbrains.mps.ide.editor.actions%29%2F6893431717880497466).

!!! question "How can I group intentions and give them names?"

    Use the language `com.mbeddr.mpsutil.intentions` from {{ mps_extensions() }}. 
    It is also possible to split the description into multiple literals. The first literal will then be used to group intentions.

    ![intention description](intention_description.png){width="600px"}

    ![intention description grouping](intention_description_result.png){width="300px"}

!!! hint "I need to get all available intentions for a node."

    ```java
    IntentionsManager.getInstance().getAvailableIntentions();
    ```

!!! question "How can you make intentions visible?"

!!! question "How can you show a submenu in the intention menu?"
    
    Specific Languages blog: [Showing a submenu in the intentions menu](https://specificlanguages.com/posts/2022-01/27-intention-submenu/)

!!! question "An Intention isn't visible, although it should be. What can you do?"

    > Intention X should be visible on Concept Y. However, when I select an instance of Y, it is not listed in the intention menu. What can I do?

    Make sure the language that declares the intention is in `Used Languages` of the model:

        - Check if the intention applies to the concept you want it to apply to. (Maybe `visible on child nodes` is not set).
        - Check if the `isApplicable` condition evaluated to true (try to avoid adding `System.err.our` prints to the model).

    Starting from 2021.1.4 JetBrains made a change to the `isApplicable` method of intentions ([commits](https://github.com/JetBrains/MPS/commits/2021.1?since=2021-10-29&until=2021-11-29)). After the changes they [regenerated](https://github.com/JetBrains/MPS/commit/d47b2380b5005a05cd02de3a59f34448daae18f6) all the intentions in the project. This change also affects 2020.3.6. The exception  happens, for example, when languages compiled with 2021.1.3 and 2021.1.4 are used together.
