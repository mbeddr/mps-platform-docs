# Plugin Aspect

> Plugins are a way to integrate your code with the MPS IDE functionality.
>
> â€” <cite>MPS documentation</cite>

## General

!!! question "Should you use this aspect?"

    No, use [plugin solutions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/mps/plugin.html) instead.

??? question "How do facets work?"

    ![facets](facets.png)

    Red rectangles: marker facets
    
    - Do not define dependencies on other facets.
    - They are known to the MPS make process and are available for users.
    - You can define where your facet should fit in and decide if you require some facet.

    Usage:

    - Targets act as filters working on a stream of data delivered to them.
    - The data flowing along targets is called *resources*.
    - Resources are represented as Java interfaces and tuples.

??? question "How do I move a solution?"

    > Given I have a project with a test solution open and the solution is stored in `code/com.my/solutions/com.my.solution.to.move`, which is the wrong place. It should be `code/com.my/test/com.my.solution.to.move` instead.

    > I want to move the solution in the filesystem to its correct place. How can I move the solution without breaking the project?

    1. Move `code/com.my/solutions/com.my.solution.to.move` to `code/com.my.project/test/com.my.project.solution.to.move`.
    2. Close the MPS project and reopen it (no need to restart MPS).
    3. Add back the *.msd* files as follows:
    3. Right-click on the workspace root node and open *Project Paths* (++alt+return++).
    4. Click on the red, old solution file, and on *-*.
    6. Click on *+* and select the new location of this *.msd* file.
    7. Open your build script for CI tests and update the solution path in the project structure.

??? question "How do you guide the user through cleaning up after deleting a referenced node?"

    > Given I have a concept `Ball` and I have a reference `BallRef`.
    > When I have a `Ball` node, and I have `BallRef`s to it all over my model.
    > When I delete the ball, then I have a lot of dangling references.
    > How may I get guidance in cleaning up these dangling references?

    You can show a balloon that says, for example:

    ```
    Deleting the ball has left some dangling references
    _Show_, _Ignore_
    ```

    When clicking *show*, it will open a usage search for the deleted node using `#!java ConsoleUtil.show`. This functionality is implemented with a model listener in a quite generic fashion.

    Here are a few insights:

    * Ensure not to show the node in the *searched for* part of the window. VCS will try to highlight it and run into an NPE (MPS 2019.3)
    * Consider cut and paste or moving elements: these operations also yield a removal event. Hide the balloon again once the node gets added again.

??? question "How can you ensure that the IDE loads a JAR exactly once and never again?"

    > I have a JAR file that depends on a native library (.dll/.so). To use it in an MPS plugin, I have a stubs solution for it. Unfortunately, without further ado, MPS sometimes tries to reload the jar (e.g., after a rebuild) and it will fail because the JVM does not allow reloading of native libraries.
    
    > How can I avoid this problem?

    To prevent that MPS will ever (re-)load .jars / stubs of a solution, you can check the facet "IDEA Plugin" in the "Facets" tab of the solution properties. This facet will show another tab where you must set the Plugin ID `com.intellij`.

    We must ensure that the JARs can be found at runtime (i.e., they must be on the classpath). The most straightforward approach would be to put them into the application's *lib* directory (e.g., MPS installation / your product RCP).

??? question "How can you use an IntelliJ icon for an action?"

    > I want to use one of the icons shipped with IntelliJ for my action (`jetbrains.mps.lang.plugin.structure.ActionDeclaration`). How can I reference the icon? (note: this question might be deprecated for modern MPS versions)

    You can use `IconLoader#getIcon` in the reflective editor. Right-click the editor for the icon, use `show reflective editor`, and enter the expression as shown in the screenshot:

??? question "How to use a projection mode switcher to alter an editor component?"

    > I have a concept editor in which I use an EditorComponent $A$. Using the projection menu entry, I would like to switch to another editor component $B$ upon activation.

    First $B$ must override $A$, and the `applicable concept` also must not differ. Then for $B$ in `applicable in context`, we must provide a *concept editor context hint*.

    ![context hints tree layout](context_hints_tree_layout.png)

    This hint must also be referenced from a *Projection Mode Switcher*.

    ![projection mode switcher](projection_mode_switcher.png)
    
    Afterwards, you will find a new entry in the *Projection* menu.
    
    Hint when used with Grammar Cells: you have to *disable component inlining*, which can be activated by an intention at the position where the include of $A$ happens. Also, in any editor component that inherits from $A$ and $A$ itself, we cannot use Grammar Cells.

## Languages/Features

!!! hint "I want to merge models."

    Use the language ^^de.itemis.mps.modelmerger^^ from {{ mps_extensions() }}.

!!! hint "I want to verify the structure of a node."

    Use the language ^^de.slisson.mps.structurecheck^^ from {{ mps_extensions() }}.

!!! hint "I want to store different states/versions of a node inside the model."

    Use the language ^^de.itemis.mps.nodeversioning^^ from {{ mps_extensions() }}.

## Open API

!!! question "How do you create a new *SContainmentLink* for a non-existent role?[^1]."

    Create it through {{ mps_url("@mps.MetaAdapterFactory") }}.

!!! question "How do you check if a model is a generator or a test model?"

    Call the corresponding method in {{ mps_url("@mps.SModelStereotype") }}.

!!! question "How do you add imports to a model?"

    Use the class {{ mps_url("@mps.ModelImportHelper") }} and call `addImport`.

!!! question "How can you open an MPS Editor Tab programmatically?"

    ```java
    EditorContext.getEditorPanelManager().openEditor(node);
    ```

!!! question "Is it possible to associate an MPS-Aspect with more than one node?"

    ```java
    IConceptAspect.getBaseConceptCollection();
    ```

## Troubleshooting

!!! warning "A reference to a key in an action context parameter is out of the search scope."

    You need to add a dependency to {{ mps_url("@mps.MPSCommonDataKeys") }}.
    This class extends {{ mps_url("@openapi.PlatformDataKeys") }}
    , and this class extends {{ mps_url("@openapi.CommonDataKeys") }}.

!!! warning "The action isn't visible."

    You have to add it to an `ActionGroup` that can be attached to different places, such as the context or build menu.
    All action context parameters marked as required must be available `#!java isApplicable` block must
    return true for an action to be visible. For debugging purposes, you can set *always visible* to true to check if your
    action is registered. 

    You must have a standalone descriptor in your model. Set the solution kind to *Other* in the *Java* tab of the solution properties ([Plugin | MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/mps/plugin.html#actionsandactiongroups)).
