**[GitHub](https://jetbrains.github.io/MPS-extensions/) contains the official documentation.**

## Richtext

> ^^slisson.richtext^^

This language provides an extendable multi-line text block (e.g., for images).
The mbeddr doc language uses it for generating XHTML, Latex, and markdown.

!!! warning "The ordering of text and IWords can't be arbitrary,"

    A checking rule enforces that the text is normalized: There has to be at least one child, it must start with a `Word`, a `Word` must always be between two embedded nodes, and there are no two consecutive Words.


## Diagram

> ^^de.itemis.mps.editor.diagram^^

!!! question "What Java libraries are used by the diagram language?"

    For the graphs itself, it uses [JGraphX](https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/docs/manual_javavis.html).[Eclipse Layout Kernel (ELK)](https://www.eclipse.org/elk/) layouts the diagram.

!!! warning "I encountered a bug."

    Check the [meta Issue](https://github.com/JetBrains/MPS-extensions/issues/120) on GitHub.

!!! question "How do you use this language?"

    Have a look at the samples of this language in {{ mps_extensions() }}. There is also an [external tutorial series](https://tillschallau.de/mps/).

!!! question "What's the edge ID in the diagrams used for?"

    Itâ€™s used in the map that contains the layout data. It can be any unique string.
    LayoutMapEntry.key is the property where this string is used ([source](https://jetbrains-mps.slack.com/archives/C99H1FR42/p1634132395020500?thread_ts=1634127497.019400&cid=C99H1FR42)).

## Tables

> ^^de.slisson.mps.tables^^

Use *slisson-tables* instead of *mps-tables* because the language is more flexible (and not deprecated).
The language displays content in a tabular format. The table can be hard-coded or contain complex queries/dynamic content.
You must add new cells and rows in the editor (they can be read-only). They include the following features:

- table cell queries
- partial tables
- grid queries

[Tabular projections in Jetbrains MPS: Let's start building an accounting system](https://tomassetti.me/tabular-projections-in-jetbrains-mps-lets-start-building-an-accounting-system/){{ blog('Strumenta') }}

??? question "How do you get rid of the small little extra grid lines on the outside of the table rows? ([original question](https://jetbrains-mps.slack.com/archives/C99H1FR42/p1632226340005700))"

    Change these properties to true. 

    ![Set Properties to true](images/table_lines_properties.png)

!!! question "How can I improve my tables?"

    - even-odd coloring of rows
    - coloring of columns and row headers
    - group columns by color
    - multi-column headers
    - annotations for cells
    - pagination + other UI buttons

## Grammar Cells

> ^^de.itemis.mps.grammarcells^^

!!! question "Grammar cells need a dummy component. Is this necessary?"

    Yes, it is. Otherwise, the generator doesn't get used ([source](https://jetbrains-mps.slack.com/archives/C3YUV3YK0/p1628146601046300)).

!!! question "What combinations of cells aren't supported?"

    The following combinations are not allowed:

    - optional and constant
    - optional and reference

!!! question "How can you enter enumerations easier?"
    
    [Entering enumerations easier with grammar cells](https://specificlanguages.com/posts/2022-02/03-entering-enumerations-easier/){{ blog('sl') }}

!!! question "How can I use the transformation language together with this language?"

    Do hide the substitute menu for a concept, create an empty substitute menu for it. When you want to add entries the traditional
    way through substitute menus, you have to use [substitute menu contribution](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/mps/transformation-menu-language.html#substitutemenucontribution) to not overwrite the automatically generated entries by the Grammar cells language.

## Querylist

> ^^com.mbeddr.mpsutil.editor.querylist^^

You can use nodes in the editor which aren't directly available in the current context. The language is more 
powerful than (read-only) model access (displays a string).
You can have editor cells with actions and all other regular cell features.
[queryListNode](http://127.0.0.1:63320/node?ref=120e1c9d-4e27-4478-b2af-b2c3bd3850b0%2Fr%3Aea4f2df6-5e5c-49de-8679-6112ec7dd9c3%28com.mbeddr.mpsutil.editor.querylist%2Fcom.mbeddr.mpsutil.editor.querylist.structure%29%2F2239254897981410197) allows accessing the surrounding context node in the editor definition (otherwise unavailable).

!!! question "How do I fold collections returned by a query list?"

    Surround the query list with a vertical collection and set the cell layout of the query list (not its content) to vertical.

??? question "How do I make cells in query lists navigatable?"

    > I'm creating a list of navigatable cells via a query list from mpsutil.
    >
    > The query lists query collects some nodes from my model, and I'd like to make it so that each cell produced with this query list navigates to its respective node.
    >
    > Using the *navigatable-node* style attribute (returning `node`, the node from the query) ) on these cells doesn't work, though - ctrl+clicking them doesn't do anything.
    >
    > How can I make the cells in a query list navigatable to that node?
    
    The `navigatable-node` style attribute won't allow you to point directly to the node from the query list's query.   
    Instead, you can use the *hyperlink-node* style attribute (also from mpsutil) to make the navigation work    and the `hyperlink-style` attribute to make it look like a regular reference:
    
    ![hyperlink node](images/hyperlink_node.png)  

    A common workaround to get similar behavior with *navigatable-node* is to point it to a child or parent of the desired node instead of that node itself.

??? "How Do I make sure that the elements are also read-only in the Inspector?"

    I have a concept A which has children b of concept B. Another concept C references A. C uses a querylist in the editor to show the list b of children. 
    As C does not own the list b (A owns it) we aim to restrict access to 'read-only'. We are setting the 'read-only' style on the query-list.
    This ensures that the list b cannot be changed. But if the concept B has a property, which is editable in the inspector, then this apporoach
    does not work. We can still edit the property, even if the concept instances of B are displayed via a query-list. 
    To achieve this you have to setup a 'read-only' style in the inspector editor for B with a query: 

    ![hyperlink node](images/read-only-query.png)

    This code snippet finds the main editor of C where the query-list is. Then it looks for the simple true/false 'read-only' style set on the query-list.

## Tooltips

> ^^de.itemis.mps.tooltips.structure^^

This language is deprecated. Use the language ^^jetbrains.mps.lang.editor.tooltips^^ instead. It provides tooltips on hover.
You have to define a regular editor and a hover editor.
