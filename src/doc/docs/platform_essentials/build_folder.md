This page describes the build folder in the project's root folder of the different platforms. The folder contains files you check in Git, such as Gradle files, generated Ant build files, and other temporary files.

Some folders described in the IETS3 section appear at the root level in the other repositories. The guide describes them
because they belong to the build process.

## {{ mps_extensions() }}

- The *generated* folder contains the generated build scripts, such as the scripts for building the languages and tests.
- The *mps* folder contains the MPS installation. The task [resolveMps](https://github.com/JetBrains/MPS-extensions/blob/master/build.gradle#L159)
resolves the MPS dependency from the *mps* configuration and copies it to this folder which also serves as the *mpsHomeDir*.

## {{ mbeddr() }}

- The *com.mbeddr.allScripts* contains the generated Ant script that includes all other build scripts. You check this file into version control.
- The *com.mbeddr.analyses.cbmc* folder contains old shell scripts for building [CBMC](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc) on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- The *com.mbeddr.release* folder contains a shell script for publishing mbeddr on GitHub.
- The *com.mbeddr* folder contains the general build script (*build.gradle*) and all the build scripts for all subprojects.
- The *publishing* folder contains a Gradle script for publishing mbeddr.
- The *thirdparty* folder contains build scripts for third-party tools used by mbeddr ([Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)).
- The *com.mbeddr.x* folders contain the generated build scripts for building the languages and tests.

## {{ iets3() }}

- The *artifacts* folder contains the generated files of the Ant scripts. This folder includes the compiled MPS plugins, the
build-all script and the plugin for the tests.
- The *config* folder contains the IntelliJ IDEA configuration directory containing user-defined IDE settings, such as keymaps, color schemes, custom VM options, platform properties, etc. For MPS, only an empty SSl subfolder exists.
- The *dependencies* folder contains the downloaded dependencies of the project. In this case, it includes the mbeddr platform + MPS Extensions.
- The *distributions* folder contains the generated artifacts of the languages and tests as zip folders.
- The *junitreport* folder contains the results of the test execution as an HTML report (*index.html*).
- The *scripts* folder contains the Ant scripts that the MPS build language generated. (TODO: Why is there a nested build folder?)
- The *system* folder is the temporary [system directory](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/mps/directories-used-by-the-ide-to-store-settings-caches-plugins-and-logs.html#system-directory) for the test execution.
- The *tmp* folder contains temporary files generated by the Java compiler.
- The *jbrDownload* folder contains the downloaded JBR version used for the build. The [downloadJbr](https://github.com/mbeddr/mps-gradle-plugin#download-jetbrains-runtime) Gradle task
comes from the [mps-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/mbeddr/mps-gradle-plugin).
