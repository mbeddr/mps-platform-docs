This page describes the connections between MPS, IntelliJ Community, JBR, TeamCity, and all open-source repositories.

**JetBrains MPS** is based on **[IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community)**. It doesn't use all the plugins but rather extends it through the [IntelliJ platform SDK](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/welcome.html) to add support for tools that can be used to design domain-specific languages. The Projectional editor of MPS is a custom editor implementation instead of the standard text editor therefore many text-based features of IntelliJ won't work (such as syntax [language injections](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/language-injections-settings.html) or [code templates](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-file-and-code-templates.html)). Some features are unused or disabled such as the [Program Structure Interface](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/psi.html) which is normally used as the layer responsible for parsing files and creating the syntactic and semantic code model.

MPS/IntelliJ IDEA requires a Java Runtime. Both use the [JetBrains Runtime](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime), a fork of OpenJDK. It includes several enhancements in font rendering, ligatures, HiDPI support, windowing/focus subsystems, performance improvements, and bug fixes. The repository **[mbeddr/build.publish.jdk](https://github.com/mbeddr/build.publish.jdk)** publishes the needed runtimes for the different MPS versions on the **[itemis nexus server](https://artifacts.itemis.cloud/#browse/browse:maven-mps)**.

A zipped version of all MPS versions as well as the most import components of MPS (jar files) such as the editor API or the model checker are also published through the repository **[mbeddr/build.publish.mps](https://github.com/mbeddr/build.publish.mps)** to the **[itemis nexus server](https://artifacts.itemis.cloud/#browse/browse:maven-mps)**.

Custom [RCP version of MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/mps/building-standalone-ides-for-your-languages.html#processoverview) can be created which are customized versions of MPS. The first big RCP was [mbeddr](http://mbeddr.com/) with its repository located at **[mbeddr/mbeddr.core](https://github.com/mbeddr/mbeddr.core)**. The old homepage is located at **[mbeddr/mbeddr.github.io](https://github.com/mbeddr/mbeddr.github.io)**.
Useful plugins were extracted into the subproject *com.mbeddr.mpsutil* with its old documentation hosted at [mbeddr.com/platform.html](http://mbeddr.com/platform.html). Some plugins and languages where later moved to a new repository **[JetBrains/MPS-extensions](https://github.com/JetBrains/MPS-extensions)**, especially the editor-related languages. The repository is hosted by JetBrains. A list of all extensions in this repository can be found [here](https://jetbrains.github.io/MPS-extensions/extensions/full_extensions_list/). Many extensions were contributed by [itemis](https://www.itemis.com/en/it-services/methods-and-tools/mps), a few of them by [DSLFoundry](https://dslfoundry.com/). The documentation for both platforms is hosted on [GitHub](https://jetbrains.github.io/MPS-extensions/) and on the [current website](http://mbeddr.com/mps-platform-docs/platform_essentials/com_mbeddr_mpsutil) respectively. Mbeddr.core has a dependency on MPS-Extensions.

The mbeddr organization also hosts [mbeddr\.formal: FASTEN (FormAl SpecificaTion ENvironment)](https://github.com/mbeddr/mbeddr.formal) which is a set of DSLs to experiment with rigorous systems and safety engineering and [mps-qa](https://github.com/mbeddr/mps-qa) which is a quality assurance tooling for MPS ([blog post](https://specificlanguages.com/posts/2022-04/12-mps-qa/)).

A further platform that builds on the other two is **[IETS3/iets3.opensource](https://github.com/IETS3/iets3.opensource)** which mostly consists of **[KernelF](https://voelter.de/data/books/kernelf-designEvoUse.pdf)**, an extensible and functional language that can be used in MPS as the core language of DSls and can be generated into Java code.

To build MPS projects, the [MPS build language](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/mps/build-language.html) is used which generates Ant scripts that can be executed on the command line. The Ant scripts can be called directly. Other projects use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) instead. The most popular build automation tool is [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). **[Mbeddr/mps-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/mbeddr/mps-gradle-plugin)** is a Gradle plugin that helps build MPS-based projects with Gradle. This plugin is used by all MPS platforms as well as many other MPS projects. It also contains a task [download-jbr](https://github.com/mbeddr/mps-gradle-plugin#download-jetbrains-runtime) which can use the JBR artifacts that were published by the build.publish.mps repository. Some plugins were extracted into the repository **[mbeddr/mps-build-backends](https://github.com/mbeddr/mps-build-backends)** which allows executing the plugin through the command line instead of using them via Gradle.

To publish the generated artifacts, the platforms use the [Maven publish plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html), a Gradle plugin that provides the ability to publish build artifacts to [Apache Maven repositories](https://maven.apache.org/). The artifacts are published to [artifacts.itemis.cloud](https://artifacts.itemis.cloud) which is a so-called [nexus repository](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/deliver/tool_nexus/) and the [Apache Maven registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry) of the corresponding GitHub project ([example](https://github.com/orgs/JetBrains/packages?repo_name=MPS-extensions)).

To run the build and execute the tests, two different tools can be used: for smaller repositories [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) are used. They can be configured through the Actions tab in the corresponding repository ([example](https://github.com/mbeddr/build.publish.mps/actions)) and are saved in the *\.github/workflows* directory of the repository.

Bigger repositories use the [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) server located at [build.mbeddr.com](https://build.mbeddr.com/). TeamCity is a [build management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_build) and [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) server. When a new branch is pushed to any of the mentioned repositories, a build is triggered and the tests are executed. Some projects require a code review and a successful build before a branch can be merged. [Build configurations](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/configure-and-run-your-first-build.html) for the different projects are saved on the server. The actual build is executed by a [build agent](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/install-and-start-teamcity-agents.html). The TeamCity server and the agents (which are sometimes not located on the same server) are run inside [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/). The source for the agent docker image is located at **[mbeddr/mbeddr.build.docker](https://github.com/mbeddr/mbeddr.build.docker)**.
