# Platform Essentials

The following pages introduce the most important languages of the platforms and how to work with the platforms in general. For mbeddr and {{ mps_extensions() }}, there are separate sections in the documentation.

Check out sandboxes and test cases in the corresponding languages to better understand how to use certain language features. Not all languages
are intuitive to use. If you aren't sure how to use a specific concept, right-click it --> *Find Usage Settings* --> *Concept Instances*/*Node usages* + *Global Scope*. You can also use the console to search for instances: 
```
#instances<scope = global>(ClassConcept)
```
