These are some points taken from the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) that make sense in MPS.

- [Fall-through: commented](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.8.4-switch): write a comment why a fall-through is necessary in a switch statement.
- [Default case is present](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.8.4-switch): always write a default case for switch statements.
- [Rules common to all identifiers](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.8.4-switch): identifiers use only ASCII letters and digits, and, in a few cases noted below, underscores. Don't use prefixes or suffixes with particular meanings. For example, these names don't adhere to the style: *name_*, *mName*, *s_name* and *kName*.
- [Package names](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.8.4-switch): package names are all lowercase, with consecutive words concatenated together (no underscores). For example, *com.example.deepspace*, not *com.example.deepSpace* or *com.example.deep_space*.
- [Class names](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.8.4-switch): should be in UpperCamelCase. Class names are typically nouns or noun phrases. For example, *Character* or *ImmutableList*. Interface names may also be nouns or noun phrases (for example, *List*), but may sometimes be adjectives or adjective phrases instead (for example, *Readable*). Test classes should start with the name of the class they're testing, and ending with Test. For example, *HashTest* or *HashIntegrationTest*.
- [Method names](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.8.4-switch): should be in lowerCamelCase. Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases. For example: `sendMessage or stop`. Underscores may appear in JUnit test method names to separate logical components of the name, with each component written in lowerCamelCase. One typical pattern is <methodUnderTest>_<state>, for example *pop_emptyStack*. No correct way exists for naming test methods.
- [Constant names](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.8.4-switch): use all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore
- [Non-constant field names](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.8.4-switch): non-constant field names (static or otherwise) should be *lowerCamelCase*. These names are typically nouns or noun phrases. For example, *computedValues* or *index*.
- [Parameter names](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.8.4-switch) should be *lowerCamelCase*. One-character parameter names in public methods should be avoided.
- [Local variable names](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.8.4-switch) should be in lowerCamelCase. Even when final and immutable, local variables are not considered to be constants, and should not be styled as constants.
- [Type variable names](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.8.4-switch): each type variable should adhere to one of two styles: a single capital letter, optionally followed by a single numeral (such as *E*, *T*, *X*, *T2*) or a name in the form used for classes, followed by the capital letter *T* (examples: *RequestT*, *FooBarT*).
- [Camel case: defined](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.8.4-switch): tutorial on how to write camelcase
- [Don't ignore caught exceptions](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.8.4-switch)
