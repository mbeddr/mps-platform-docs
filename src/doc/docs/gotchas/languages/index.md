!!! question "What is the relationship between `mbeddr.platform`, `iets3.opensource` and `mps-extensions`?"

    Older versions of mbeddr.platform and iets3-opensource contain a dependency to mps-extensions and they repack it. The newest version of
    mbeddr.platform doesn't repack it. mps-extension contains many extensions that were part of mbeddr.platform. Not all extensions were
    migrated because they are not mature enough.
