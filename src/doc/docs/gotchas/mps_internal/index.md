!!! warning "My project is not a project"

    > I want to call `GenerationCheckHelper.checkModelsBeforeGenerationIfNeeded` to check my model. It that takes a `Project` but my `Project` that I get  as an action context isn't the correct project. The type system complains that it's not the correct class.

    > How do I get the correct project class?

    The two `Project` interfaces  are always a source of confusion. Essentially one comes from the IntelliJ platform and the other one holds MPS specific parts of the project.

    `com.intellij.openapi.project.Project`:  The project from the platform is stores basic information like the folder where the project is located and give access to project plugins for instance.
    
    `jetbrains.mps.project.Project`: MPS specific aspects of a project like model access or the repository. It also gives access to the modules (languages and solutions) of the project.
    
    To get the *MPS Project* from a *Idea Project* use `ProjectHelper.fromIdeaProject`.
    
    To the a *Idea Project* from the *MPS Project* case the interface to `MPSProject`, if you only have a `jetbrains.mps.project.Project`, and then call `getProject` on it.

    You can create a copy of you MPS installation and edit the idea.properties file in the bin directory.

    If you donâ€™t want to share any configuration also update idea.config.path.

!!! question "How can I register an IntelliJ extension?"

    Find the interface you want to add an extension on [this page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/extension-point-list.html).
    The corresponding interface has a static field `EP_NAME`. If the interface is implemented in Kotlin it might have a static field `Companion` with a `getEP_NAME()` method. Extend this interface (EX) and register it through the extension point.
    Example: `Interface.EP_NAME.getPoint().registerExtension(new Ex())`

!!! question "How can I add a status bar widget?"

    Implement the interface `StatusBarWidgetFactory` and register it through the StatusBarWidgetFactory.EP_NAME extension point.

    You need to open MPS in IDEA (Community Edition is enough), compile and run it from there, then you can edit MPS sources. There are instructions in [README](https://github.com/JetBrains/MPS).

    > Examples:

    > - when the console shows something I don't understand, I'd like to see its context source code, so that I can figure out what to do next.

    **Option 0**: Use Language Debugging facilities of MPS instead.

    For built-in languages, MPS brings a load of dedicated debugging facilities:

    - Debugging **editor cells and nodes**: When you right-click an item in the editor, you can find a submenu "Language Debug".
    - Debugging **menu entries**: Select an item that you're curious in and press CMD+Alt+B (Ctrl+Alt+B) to open the _Menu Trace_ of it.
    - Setup and an IntelliJ and connect it to step through java code.

    **Option 1**: Search for literals from console.

    **Option 2**: Search through serialized Java.

    1. Set up IntelliJ with your project.
    2. Hit CMD+Shift+F (Ctrl+Shift+F) to search in path.
    3. When you found a class of interest, open it in MPS via CMD+N (Ctrl+N). The source node usually has a similar name.

    This is great for finding editor nodes, for example, if that java class is named `Vehicle_EditorBuilder`, your source node was an editor for the `Vehicle` concept.

    **Last Resort**: Search XML model directly

    Use this only if you have no Assembly and your project doesn't open. The serialized API is subject to change and using this should be the last barrier.

    Then I use `ack` on the command line to find the relevant models that contain this string. The output even contains the node id though, as in this example:

    ```
    $ ack "ack com.mbeddr.mpsutil.grammarcells"
    â€¦
    <node concept="3bR9La" id="1aL6sVX49Cb" role="1SiIV1">
        <property role="3bR36h" value="false" />
        <ref role="3bR37D" to="90a9:F1NWDqq_DA" resolve="com.mbeddr.mpsutil.grammarcells.runtime" />
    </node>
    â€¦
    ```

    Use `#!java new IdEncoder().parseNodeId("1aL6sVX49Cb")` to get the node id.
    This will print the corresponding node to console. Clicking it will open in in MPS:

    ```java
    #nodes.where({~it => 
    boolean equals = false; 
    try { 
        equals = it/.getNodeId().equals(new IdEncoder().parseNodeId("1aL6sVX49Cb")); 
    } catch (Exception e) { 
        <no statements> 
    } 
    return equals; 
    })
    ```

    {{ question_by('cwalesch') }}

    The repository is what is represented as the "modules pool" in the UI. It contains all the dependencies currently visible. At the moment there is only one global repository which causes several problems. MPS is slowly but steadily moving to project specific repositories. That would mean each project (window) of MPS would have it's own separate repository. 

    To get the repository you will need access to the project. e.g. the editor context will give you access to the repository: `editorContext.getRepository()`.
    
    In other cases for instance when you don't have an editor context directly available you need to make sure that from UI (action) you pass the project or repository though to the place where you need it.

??? question "How can I get an identifier of a node?"

    > Given I have a node myNode and I need to serialize something that identifies it.
    > When I serialize that something and then deserialize that identifier again, then I will find exactly that node.
    > How can I build such a thing?

    **Option 1**: PersistenceFacade Id

    Since the url does not look nice; you may use this combined string of model-id and node id that is used for the Url. For that, import the class `org.jetbrains.mps.openapi.persistence.PersistenceFacade` from the _MPS.OpenApi_ stub and run:
    
    ```java
    # serialize identifier
    string mySerializedId = SNodePointer.serialize(node/.getReference())
    
    # find node based on serialized identifier
    node<> myFoundNode = SNodePointer.deserialize(mySerializedId).resolve(repository)
    
    # then, node == myFoundNode
    ```

    **Option 2**: Url
    
    Import the `httpsupport` language and use `node.getURL`. This will be a url that you can use locally to open this node. It includes the node id and the model and thus is a pretty good globally unique id.
    
    This id is a local URL and looks odd though: `http://127.0.0.1:63320/node?ref=r%3A4bc03cd1-b1e3-49da-84da-f27e7062f6f7%28integrityOfUpdate%29%2F2209769512593382448&project=SecurityAnalyst`. Especially the code to find the node again based on this url contains some grepping then.
    
    **Option 3**: Node Id
    
    Use `#!java node/.getNodeId().toString()` it will yield the nodes id. Note that a nodeid is **only unique within this model**. If it should be globally unique, consider the next options.
    
    You could also deserialize this again somehow, but I don't have at hand, how.
