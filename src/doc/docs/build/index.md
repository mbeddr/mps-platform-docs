# Continuous Integration

## Docker
Docker is a linux container technology that we use heavily within our build. You can think of it as a very lightweight virtual machine. In addition to the container runtime docker also includes the tools required to build preconfigured images that are then executed in the container. These images are built from a Dockerfile. Essentially everything in our infrastructure is provisioning using docker from the teamcity frontend over the database to the build agent. For the build agent this approach allows us to keep the build agents consistent in their installed software and their versions. The Dockerfile for our general purpose agents can be found at GitHub. The docker image build from the docker file is published to docker hub, hosting service for images, and then used in our build server.

The complete docker configuration for our build server is hosted on the itemis GitLab here. It also included the scripts that download/update the docker image and run the agent. Since our teamcity setup uses multiple containers, a separate container for the database or the webserver that handles the encrypted connection, we are using docker-compose as an orchestration tool.
