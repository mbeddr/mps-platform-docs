The following items are cited from different UX guidelines from the web:

[Windows Design Techniques](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/uxguide/how-to-design-desktop-ux#design-techniques):

> - Determine the features your users need. Understand your users' needs through goal, scenario, and task analysis. Determine a set of features that realizes these objectives.

> - Remove unnecessary elements. Remove elements that aren't likely to be used or have preferable alternatives.

> - Remove unnecessary redundancy. There might be several effective ways to perform a task. To achieve simplicity, make the hard decision and choose the best one for your target users instead of providing all of them and making the choice an option.

> - Make it "just work" automatically. The element is necessary, but any user interaction to get it to work is not because there is an acceptable default behavior or configuration. To achieve simplicity, make it work automatically and either hide it from the user completely or reduce its exposure significantly.

> - Combine what should be combined. Put the essential features that support a task together so that a task can be performed in one place. The task's steps should have a unified, streamlined flow. Break down complex tasks into a set of easy, clear steps, so that "one" place might consist of several UI surfaces, such as a wizard.

> - Separate what should be separated. Not everything can be presented in one place, so always have clear, well-chosen boundaries. Make features that support core scenarios central and obvious, and hide optional functionality or make it peripheral. Separate individual tasks and provide links to related tasks. For example, tasks related to manipulating photos should be clearly separated from tasks related to managing collections of photos, but they should be readily accessible from each other.

> - Eliminate what can be eliminated. Take a printout of your design and highlight the elements used to perform the most important tasks. Even highlight the individual words in the UI text that communicate useful information. Now review what isn't highlighted and consider removing it from the design. If you remove the item, would anything bad happen? If not, remove it!
  Consistency, configurability, and generalization are often desirable qualities, but they can lead to unnecessary complexity. Review your design for misguided efforts in consistency (such as having redundant text), generalization (such as having any number of time zones when two is sufficient), and configurability (such as options that users aren't likely to change), and eliminate what can be eliminated.

> - Put the elements in the right place. Within a window, an element's location should follow its utility. Essential controls, instructions, and explanations should all be in context in logical order. If more options are needed, expose them in context by clicking a chevron or similar mechanism; if more information is needed, display an infotip on mouse hover. Place less important tasks, options, and Help information outside the main flow in a separate window or page. The technique of displaying additional detail as needed is called progressive disclosure.

> - Use meaningful high-level combinations. It is often simpler and more scalable to select and manipulate groups of related elements than individual elements. Examples of high-level combinations include folders, themes, styles, and user groups. Such combinations often map to a user goal or intention that isn't apparent from the individual elements. For example, the intention behind the High Contrast Black color scheme is far more apparent than that of a black window background.

> - Select the right controls. Design elements are embodied by the controls you use to represent them, so selecting the right control is crucial to efficient presentation. For example, the font selection box used by Microsoft Word shows both a preview of the font as well as the most recently used fonts. Similarly, the way Word shows potential spelling and grammar errors in place is much simpler than the dialog box alternative, as shown in the beginning of this article.

> - Make tasks discoverable and visible. All tasks, but especially frequent tasks, should be readily discoverable within the user interface. The steps required to perform tasks should be visible and should not rely on memorization.

> - Present tasks in the user's domain. Complex software requires users to map their problems to the technology. Simple software does that mapping for them by presenting what is natural. For example, a red-eye reduction feature maps directly to the problem space and doesn't require users to think in terms of details like hues and gradients.

> - Put domain knowledge into the program. Users shouldn't be required to access external information to use your application successfully. Domain knowledge can range from complex data and algorithms to simply making it clear what type of input is valid.

> - Use text that users understand. Well-crafted text is crucial to effective communication with users. Use concepts and terms familiar to your users. Fully explain what is being asked in plain language so that users can make intelligent, informed decisions.

> - Use safe, secure, probable defaults. If a setting has a value that applies to most users in most circumstances, and that setting is both safe and secure, use it as the default value. Make users specify values only when necessary.

> - Use constraints. If there are many ways to perform a task, but only some are correct, constrain the task to those correct ways. Users should not be allowed to make readily preventable mistakes.

[Window UX Top Violations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/uxguide/top-violations):

> - Use ordinary, conversational terms when you can. Focus on the user goals, not technology. This is especially effective if you are explaining a complex technical concept or action. Imagine yourself looking over the user's shoulder and explaining how to accomplish the task. IN CONFLICT WITH Domain

> - Be polite, supportive, and encouraging. The user should never feel condescended to, blamed, or intimidated.

> - Remove redundant text. Look for redundant text in window titles, main instructions, supplemental instructions, content areas, command links, and commit buttons. Generally, leave full text in main instructions and interactive controls, and remove any redundancy from the other places.

> - Use title-style capitalization for titles, and sentence-style capitalization for all other UI elements.

> - For feature and technology names, be conservative in capitalizing. Typically, only major components should be capitalized (using title-style capitalization).

> - For feature and technology names, be consistent in capitalizing. If the name appears more than once on a UI screen, it should always appear the same way. Likewise, across all UI screens in the program, the name should be consistently presented.

> - Don't capitalize the names of generic user interface elements, such as toolbar, menu, scroll bar, button, and icon.
Exceptions: Address bar, Links bar, ribbon.

> - Don't use blue text that isn't a link, because users may assume that it is a link. Use bold or a shade of gray where you'd otherwise use colored text.

> - Use bold sparingly to draw attention to text users must read.

> - Don't place periods at the end of control labels or main instructions.

> - Use one space between sentences. Not two.

> - Label every control or group of control

> - For all controls, select the safest (to prevent loss of data or system access), most secure value by default. If safety and security aren't factors, select the most likely or convenient value.

> - Use notifications for events that are unrelated to the current user activity, don't require immediate user action, and users can freely ignore.

> - Don't abuse notifications:
Use notifications only if you need to. When you display a notification, you are potentially interrupting users or even annoying them. Make sure that interruption is justified.
Use notifications for non-critical events or situations that don't require immediate user action. For critical events or situations that require immediate user action, use an alternative UI element (such as a modal dialog box).
Don't use notifications for feature advertisements!

> - Never require users to click an object to determine if it is clickable. Users must be able to determine clickability by visual inspection alone.

> - Whenever possible, propose a solution so users can fix the problem. However, make sure the proposed solution is likely to solve the problem. Don't waste users' time by suggesting possible, but improbable, solutions.

> - Be specific. Avoid vague wording, such as syntax error and illegal operation. Provide specific names, locations, and values of the objects involved.

> - Don't use phrasing that blames the user or implies user error. Avoid using you and your in the phrasing. While the active voice is generally preferred, use the passive voice when the user is the subject and might feel blamed for the error if the active voice were used.

> - Don't use OK for error messages. Users don't view errors as being OK. If the error message has no direct action, use Close instead.

> - Don't use the following words:
Error, failure (use problem instead)
Failed to (use unable to instead)
Illegal, invalid, bad (use incorrect or not valid instead)
Abort, kill, terminate (use stop instead)
Catastrophic, fatal (use serious instead)

## Dark theme

Use the predefined colors in MPS or define your own colors using the class  [JBColor](http://127.0.0.1:63320/node?ref=498d89d2-c2e9-11e2-ad49-6cf049e62fe5%2Fjava%3Acom.intellij.ui%28MPS.IDEA%2F%29%2F%7EJBColor) with the constructor `JBColor(light theme color, dark theme color)`. By using this class, it shouldn't be necessary to verify if the user is [using the Darcula theme](https://stackoverflow.com/c/itemis-mps/questions/426). The MPS colors already support the light and dark theme because they inherit from `JBColor`. As seen in the screenshot below, the colors can be different when using the dark theme (for example: the white and black colors). Don't use hard-coded hex colors or the class [Color](http://127.0.0.1:63320/node?ref=6354ebe7-c22a-4a0f-ac54-50b52ab9b065%2Fjava%3Ajava.awt%28JDK%2F%29%2F%7EColor).

  <figcaption>Light theme</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure markdown>
  ![dark theme](dark_theme_colors.png)
  <figcaption>Dark theme</figcaption>
</figure>

Make sure that the foreground color is readable for the chosen background (see preceding screenshots). You can use an online [contrast checker tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to verify that the color combination is readable.

Example for colors with a good contrast ratio (foreground: black, the ratio can be found after the hex code):

![good color ratio](colors_good_contrast_ratio.png)

If this change isn't feasible, you can switch to the default theme (useful for RCPs):

```java
class LookAndFeel {
    void set() {
        LafManager lafManager = LafManager.getInstance();
        QuickChangeLookAndFeel.switchLafAndUpdateUI(lafManager, LafManagerImpl.getTestInstance().getDefaultLightLaf(), false);
    }
}
```
