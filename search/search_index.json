This page contains the reference for the material theme. Install extra MkDocs plugins in build.gradle + mkdocs.yml. If you are using IntelliJ for editing, it is recommended to install the plugin Grazie Professional for spell checking. Editing \u00b6 The first header should be # . Inserted images with Markdown, not HTML: ![description](url){width=\"600px\"} . Set the with to 600px or 300px, depending on how big or small the image is footnotes syntax The target=_blank attribute and an icon for external links gets automatically added to links. The following symbols must be escaped: $ is &#36; because it collides with inline Latex blocks. Extensions \u00b6 Besides the Material extensions, the project used the following Pymdown extensions: pymdownx.betterem : different emphasis handling pymdownx.inlinehilite : inline code highlighting; example: #!js var test = 0; pymdownx.magiclink : linkafies URLs pymdownx.smartsymbols : inserts commonly used Unicode characters via ASCII representations. pymdownx.superfences : extension to Markdown fences pymdownx.details : collapsible elements pymdownx.highlight pymdownx.snippets : include other Markdown or HTML snippets into the current Markdown file pymdownx.keys : simplifies inserting key inputs; example: Ctrl + Alt + Del pymdownx.caret : superscript text via caret pymdownx.mark : enables marking words pymdownx.tilde : subscript text via tilde pymdownx.emoji : support for custom Emojis. Some example icons are in MPS Icons . pymdownx.tasklist : support for lists with checkboxes mk_in_html : support for markdown in HTML pymdownx.magiclink : additional link related features Macros \u00b6 The plugin mkdocs-macros-plugin is activated. You can add variables to the extra section of mkdocs.yml (example: mps_latest ) and use the available macros: contribution_by(github_username) question_by(github_username) answer_by(github_username) mps_url(identifier) image_popup() iets3() mbeddr() mbeddr_platform() mps_extensions() mps Look through main.py to see how they are implemented. The identifier can start with one of the following special identifiers: @openapi @mps @baselang @mpsutil @itemis @mbeddr @iets3 The special identifiers get translated to the corresponding package names. Only the last part of the identifier has to be the correct name. The identifier can reference classes, interfaces, concept, and interface declarations in baselanguage, mps-extensions, mbeddr, and iets3. The rest of the identifier only helps to find the correct node and doesn\u2019t have to be exact. Example: @mps.ClassConcept will find jetbrains.mps.baseLanguage.structure.ClassConcept . When the wrong node is selected, enter more parts of the full qualified name of the node. Diagrams \u00b6 Kroki enables support for diagrams ( examples ). It supports the following diagrams: BlockDiag BlockDiag (simple block diagrams) SeqDiag (simple sequence diagrams) ActDiag (simple activity diagrams) NwDiag (simple network diagrams) PacketDiag (packet header diagrams) RackDiag (rack diagrams) BPMN Bytefield C4 (with PlantUML) Ditaa Erd Excalidraw GraphViz Mermaid Nomnoml Pikchr PlantUML Structurizr SvgBob UMLet Vega Vega-Lite WaveDrom They can be embedded by creating a code block and the text kroki-[diagramtype] .

Are node factories used when calling new node ? No. More information can be found in Editor Actions | MPS . Where can you find all key mappings for the editor? Windows and mac shortcuts for editor actions can be found in MPSEditorActions.xml . Why is a custom action map not executed on a CellModel_Collection ? In MPS I have the possiblity to reference an action map from a editor collection cell. However it seems like my defined actions are never executed when the editor is used. Why is this so and how to fix it? Reason for the Problem In general the applied actions should be invoked and executed. However depending on the content of the collection cells, MPS might generate some default actions which will override your custom actions. Example You have a read only model access cell inside the collection cell: In this case the internal MPS generator for CellModel_ReadOnlyModelAccessor will automatically generate and register some default actions like delete/backspace which in the end will prohibit your custom action to be applied. Solution You can use the cell explorer ( Language Debug \u2192 Show Cell in Explorer ) to see which actions are defined for a cell.

(A) What it looks like after creation (B) Initial situation with cursor at (1) : pressing Enter leads to (C) The problem is, that in (C) the cursor is at (2) , right before a read-only cell and thus editing or moving to the next cell is not possible.

Structure of the new node in (C) : Editor of the new node in (C) : Usually, you would set the attracts focus property of the cell, where the cursor should be positioned, to attractsFocus or FirstEditableCell . But, since ( C.2 and C.3 ) are error cells, the default behaviour is to set the cursor in front of the first error cell, which is (C.2) .

A cell takes up a specific amount of space in the editor component (width and height). padding-left/right/top/bottom: a floating point number, which specifies the padding of a text cell, i.e. how much space will be between cell\u2019s text and cell\u2019s left and right sides, respectively. inset: representation of the borders of an element. It specifies the space that an element must leave at each of its edges. baseline: the line upon which most letters sit. ascent: the recommended distance above the baseline for singled spaced text. descent: the recommended distance below the baseline for singled spaced text. height: ascent + descent gap: space between cells in a collection. There is a left and right gap. How can you set editor hints? you can set hints via editorContext . getEditorComponent (). getUpdater () explicit hints for nodes initial hints globally; they behave similar to pushed hints. via right-click: push editor hints and select a specific one. via an EditorHintToggleAction (e.g. in action declarations) They are not visible in the push Editor hints menu. If you need the same behavior e.g. in intentions, you can use code from there (via ConceptEditorHintSettingsComponent.HintsState ) Explicit hints for nodes and hints via EditorHintToggleAction . The usage of ConceptEditorHintSettingsComponent.HintsState is not so obvious. How do you set the cursor to the first editable cell? (A) What it looks like after creation (B) Initial situation with cursor at (1) : pressing Enter leads to (C) The problem is, that in (C) the cursor is at (2) , right before a read-only cell and thus editing or moving to the next cell is not possible. I would like the cursor to jump to the first editable cell, which is at position (3) . Structure of the new node in (C) : Editor of the new node in (C) : Usually, you would set the attracts focus property of the cell, where the cursor should be positioned, to attractsFocus or FirstEditableCell . But, since ( C.2 and C.3 ) are error cells, the default behaviour is to set the cursor in front of the first error cell, which is (C.2) . Therefore, change the first part of your editor to a querylist cell (A) , which references the \u201cmember\u201d in the cell properties (B) and set the read-only property on the querylist. contributed by: @aquapp Is it possible to access the selected value of one swing component from inside another swing component?

INSTANCES_COLOR , \"usage\" , messageOwner ); The second approach has a better performance, because the highlighter runs asynchronously and not during the editor rebuild. How can you hide a custom cell in the editor? ( show if property) Custom cells expect only a cell provider in the inspector, but don\u2019t offer the possibility to specify other attributes to set e.g. \u201cshow if\u201d. How can I hide a custom cell under a specific condition? ( MPS -33195 ) The meta model actually allows to specify the show if property and other attributes on a custom cell and the generator will generate the correct code for it. It is just not included in the editor for the inspector. You can use the reflective editor to specify the condition. Since these attributes are hidden and you need this knowledge to find them, the alternative for a better visibility is to surround the custom cell with a collection and set the show if property on the collection. contributed by: @aquapp","title":"Editor declaration"},{"location":"aspects/editor/#open-api","text":"How can you open the inspector programmatically? 1 editorContext . openInspector () Specific Languages Blog: Opening Inspector automatically Specific Languages Blog: Opening Inspector automatically: Selection listeners Specific Languages Blog: Opening Inspector automatically: Editor extensions How can you open the editor for a node programmatically? 1 NavigationSupport . getInstance (). openNode () How can you override an arbitrary editor?

Specific Languages Blog: How MPS collects generators to engage on a model genplan (in devkit) vs. generator priorities? The genplan is applied instead of the generator priorities. If your generator should be applied in a model using a genplan, your generator has to be part of the genplan. When developing a language, which is used within an aspect, e.g. typesystem, the MPS aspect\u2019s genplan can block the generator. How can you use generated classes which implement an extension-point? Let \\(L_A\\) be a language which offers an extension-point over class \\(E\\) . Then it is quite simple to provide a static implementation for extension-point for \\(E\\) for example in another language. What if we have want map a concept \\(Q\\) of \\(B\\) to that extension-point? We want to be able to generated Code \\(C\\) from a oncept instance of \\(Q\\) which is a subclass of \\(E\\) , such that we can use it for the extension-point over class \\(E\\) . Create the extension point in the plugin aspect of language \\(L_A\\) . In generator main you need to create two root mapping rules for \\(Q\\) (which is ModelMerge in our case). map_ModelMerge maps \\(Q\\) to a class which extends \\(E\\) (here ConceptMergeSpec ). map_ModelMerge_extension will generate an extension for \\(Q\\) . It is a extension RootMapping which can be selected from the intention. The code for the Reference-Macro in the figure above should look like this. Make sure you have jetbrains.mps.lang.extension included as language in the plugin. Now create a solution, not a sandbox. Set Solution Kind in the properties to Other .

Generation plans should be used when the generation order is simple. How do you generate language X from MPS ? Specific Languages blog: How do I generate language XY from MPS ? How can you make sure that a generator B can use the output of a generator A? Define priorities or a fixed genplan for \\(B\\) (and maybe \\(A\\) ) If you can\u2019t run / don\u2019t want to run both generators in the same \u201cphase\u201d, configure them to run one after each other. Solution 1 : Define a \\(MM\\) (structure) (INFO-NODE) in \\(A\\) where you accumulate all required information and pass for all other generators. Configure \\(A\\) to remove INFO-NODE if not required (separate mapping configuration). Solution 2 : Define an annotation and store all req. infos there Configure \\(A\\) to drop annotation if not required (separate mapping configuration), Solution 3 : Use user objects to store required information as part of the real AST nodes. User objects are volatile children/properties which are not persisted but survive several generation phases. Use com.mbeddr.mpsutil.genutil to achieve this. Solution 4 : Define a fixed genplan with checkpoints. Organize the whole generation process manually. How to generate large strings? Given I am writing a generator and it generates a java string for a string property. That property holds a string of more than 64000 characters and the java compiler gives me a constant string too long error. What can I do? This is how it looks like so far: Option 1 : Extract into a separate file Of course it would be better to not fill the java file too much and instead generate the string into a file that gets loaded at this place. Option 2 : Split and join again The restriction only applies to the size of string literals. However, at runtime, it is allowed to have larger strings. So that we can split it into a concatenation that gets assembled at runtime then: Here we use the Guiva classes Joiner and Splitter from MPS.Core/google.common.base and java.util.Arrays . We use the splitter at generation time to split it into parts of maximal 50000 characters. Then we map it onto an arbitrary node that has a string property, as $LOOP$ requires a node In the property macro inside the loop, we simply pull that property out of the node again (the inspector of this is not visible in the screenshot) It is just a coincidence that we create nodes of the same concept and use the same property for the loop content, than for the outside context node. You may light-quote anything of type string here. contributed by: @abstraktor Open API \u00b6 How can you preview the generated text programmatically? Use the MPS action TextPreviewModel or call the methods in TextGeneratorEngine if you want to use the text generator. How do you get the output path for a solution? To get an IFile , call SModelOperations . getOutputLocation ( model ) . To get an string, call ProjectPathUtil . getGeneratorOutputPath ( module . getModuleDescriptor ()) . You have to first cast the module to an AbstractModule. How can I check if a model requires generation programmatically? The project view shows generation required if a model has been changed. What is the source of this information, and how reliable is it? (regarding the 2 nd part of the question: sometimes the text in the project view is not up to date, but pressing F5 fixes it. Is it just the UI that is not updated when the underlying state changes, or is the state itself not updated properly until F5 is pressed?) ModelGenerationStatusManager provides a corresponding API. This is how to use it: 1 2 3 4 MPSProject project = /* ... */ ; SModel model = /* ... */ ; ModelGenerationStatusManager statusManager = project . getComponent ( ModelGenerationStatusManager . class ); if ( statusManager . generationRequired ( model )) { /* ... */ } Unfortunately, it does\u2019nt seem to be reliable, e.g. when changing something in the model, the API behaves correctly in the first place. But after executing the Synchronize action, MPS for some reason believes that generation is not required any more (even though the change would have an effect on the output and Synchronize doesn\u2019t execute the generation). This odd behavior can also be seen in the project view (note: this might be outdated information). contributed by: @till-f Troubleshooting \u00b6 MPS can\u2019t resolve the import XY. 3 The solution that contains the class has to be added as a runtime solution (see here ). Why are root nodes generated more than once? Have you used one of your root nodes as a child of another node? It will still act as a root node in this case. No output location for XY. Make sure that the Java facet is enabled in the properties of the language or solution. This error can often be seen when opening an old MPS project. How do I debug generators? Specific Languages Blog: Debugging generators The generated code has no debug symbols. Locate the build solution in MPS that is building your languages and adjust the java settings: java options <project default> generate debug info false generate no warnings false fork false compiler <default compiler> java compliance level 1.8 java compiler options <no additional options> copy resources false Then set generate debug info to true. If no java options exist in your build solution, simply add one in the project structure. How can you debug the differences of generation between command line and MPS ? Given I have an MPS project and it compiles well in my MPS . When I run the same in a command line then I see a compile error. How can I debug this? The issue behind this kind of issues usually lies in one of these three things: Issue Area 1 : Settings (inplace, threading) Try turning off Apply transformations in place in your MPS settings under Build, Execution, Deployment \u2192 Generator \u2192 General , as this is unset in the command line (note, that this setting doesn\u2019t appear in the search): Also, disabling the build in parallel threads may help. Issue Area 2 : Dependencies A second issue may originate from the separate type of class loading and dependency loading in the command line. Issue Area 3 : Generation plans The command line build runs the generator plans that are included in the devkits of a model, or that are explicitly added to the generator facet+tab of a module. If your code starts the build for an explicit generation plan other than that, consider if a different plan could be the culprit. (Remember, right-clicking a model and Show Generation Plan to see if all looks as expected). Remark 1: Inplace transformations are on or off depending on your build script, same applied to parallel generation. On the command line if nothing specified it defaults to 4 threads. The biggest difference is that in the command line build not project is opened, which means anything that tried to access the project including virtual files will fail. Remark 2: One potential source of problems could be packaging of languages and generators. Because in the command line build generators might need to be loaded from packaged jars, any issues with that packaging could affect the generation. For example, as it currently may happen due to MPS -32026 that whole generator models with templates are not loaded and therefore not applied during the generation in the command line. contributed by: @abstraktor MPS forum - I want to export multiple languages from MPS \u21a9 MPS forum - Is it possible to export a DSL compiler created with MPS and use it independently \u21a9 MPS forum - Generator error: uncaught exception ?no classifier? \u21a9","title":"Generator"},{"location":"aspects/generator/#generator-aspect","text":"Generator is a part of language specification that defines the denotational semantics for the concepts in the language. \u2014 MPS documentation","title":"Generator aspect"},{"location":"aspects/generator/#general","text":"Are there any best practices for generators? coolya: Maintainable MPS Generators Can you invoke the generator from an external tool? 2 Yes, it can be run from Ant.

Issue Area 2 : Dependencies A second issue may originate from the separate type of class loading and dependency loading in the command line. Issue Area 3 : Generation plans The command line build runs the generator plans that are included in the devkits of a model, or that are explicitly added to the generator facet+tab of a module. If your code starts the build for an explicit generation plan other than that, consider if a different plan could be the culprit. (Remember, right-clicking a model and Show Generation Plan to see if all looks as expected). Remark 1: Inplace transformations are on or off depending on your build script, same applied to parallel generation. On the command line if nothing specified it defaults to 4 threads. The biggest difference is that in the command line build not project is opened, which means anything that tried to access the project including virtual files will fail. Remark 2: One potential source of problems could be packaging of languages and generators. Because in the command line build generators might need to be loaded from packaged jars, any issues with that packaging could affect the generation. For example, as it currently may happen due to MPS -32026 that whole generator models with templates are not loaded and therefore not applied during the generation in the command line. contributed by: @abstraktor MPS forum - I want to export multiple languages from MPS \u21a9 MPS forum - Is it possible to export a DSL compiler created with MPS and use it independently \u21a9 MPS forum - Generator error: uncaught exception ?no classifier? \u21a9","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"aspects/intentions/","text":"Intentions aspect \u00b6 Intentions provide fast access to the most used operations with syntactical constructions of a language. \u2014 MPS documentation How can you go to the declaration of an intention when you open the intention menu?

My test case has a check node called data and my test case has a a test test1 which prints the node ID of data My test case has a a test test2 which prints the node id of data . When I run the test test1 and test2 print different node IDs. Why is that? Terms used: check-node for these fixture nodes that you enter into the test case under nodes test case for the root node, the chunk that contains the tests tests for the test methods of which we have test1 and test2 Each test case runs on its own copy of its model. MPS tries to keep tests reproducible and isolated even when being run in-process. For that, MPS copies the whole model into a temporary model. Modifications of one test case will then be invisible to the next test case, since it will work on a new temporary model. This prevents test-cases from interacting. Running tests in a separate model ensures that they will never modify the original model (as long as you don\u2019t explicitly start acting on other models). Check-nodes per test A test-case may have multiple tests though. MPS also isolates single tests within the same test case. For that, the check-nodes are copied once for each test. Each test may then act on their own copy. 1 2 // there is one data node in the model for each test assert 2 equals data . model . nodes ( Data ). size All tests of a test-case share their referenced nodes To save memory though, these check-nodes all lie in the same model for each test case. References to other nodes outside the test case will only need to be copied once and be shared by all tests of that test case. As a result, the IDs of check-nodes change and the IDs of non-check-nodes are the same as in the original model. 1 2 // nodes in this model that are not check-nodes of this test case will only be there once assert 1 equals dataRef . model . nodes ( Chunk ). size ; Consequently, multiple tests of the same test case are not fully isolated. In the following example, both tests assert and do the same, yet test3 passes while test4 fails. The data element is now located in a separate chunk outside the testcase and the check-node is a reference to it. As a result, test4 is running red because test3 already modified the referenced node. Kinds of tests I checked this behavior in-depth for node tests. I think it is similar for editor tests. I am sure that this does not apply to baseLang-tests since they don\u2019t prepare a temporary model for you. Practical effects of this \u00b6 These are some rules of thumb that result from that: The tests of a test-case may interact, so you should inline all modified nodes into the testcase to be check-nodes . Whenever you modify many nodes in the model, consider writing a migration and migration test instead. Remember that the console and each test will output separate IDs for the conceptually same node. And they will change from run to run. Especially when stepping through tests, it is easy to be confused by that and draw false conclusions Whenever your code queries for the nodes of a model, be ready to see duplicates for each test (as in the dataRef example). You may test this by asserting that something is included or excluded instead of asserting true equality of the expected and actual lists. Another source for duplicates is if the test model imports itself. If you need full power on the temporary model, consider writing a baseLanguage test and creating your repository and model by hand. jetbrains.mps.smodel.TestModelFactory allows to do that, e.g. the ModelListenerTest uses that TestModelFactory.

I would like to write a generator smoke test. Therefor, I have some solutions with models (regular one, not @test models) which are build from command line and the generators invoked are generating some .c files. In addition, I also have a @test model in the same solution with some unit tests which checks if the output directories of these models contain any generated files. I don\u2019t invoke the generation of the models programatically but rely on the ant task which is generating the solution. Unfortunately this setup always leads to broken tests. It seems like the unit tests are executed before the models (which are build during CI run) and though the test fails. asked by: @arimer When the tests work fine when run from within the IDE , then the problem is most probably that when your tests are executed, they are running from the jars and not the sources. The generator output location points into the jar file that the tests are executed from and not to the real source location. You could change the packaging to include the source_gen folder for you specific test solution. This can be done the following way in the default layout of your build model: In this case you would need to detect if you are running from sources or from jar in CI and the change the location where you look for the generated files. This can be done by calculation a solution relative path for the test solution containing the packed sources. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 //case running from .jar if ( module instanceof AbstractModule && (( AbstractModule ) module ). getModuleSourceDir () != null ) { AbstractModule s = (( AbstractModule ) module ); if ( s . isPackaged () && s . getModuleSourceDir (). getBundleHome () != null ) { IFile bundleHome = s . getModuleSourceDir (). getBundleHome (); return bundleHome . getFileSystem (). getFile ( bundleHome . getPath () + \"!\" + path ); } // case: running from sources IFile relativePath = s . getModuleSourceDir (). getDescendant ( path ); return relativePath ; } The easier solution is to place the tests in separate solution and then invoke the make process for the solution that contains your input programmatically, so you can assert over the output.

When you use the transform keyword it will just copy the input and all its descendants. If any input concept matches a transformation rule parameter in the auto apply part, it will transform the input according to the matched transformation. What does the transform statement do? It has the same meaning as a COPY_SRC macro in MPS and it will just copy the input node and apply a rule.","title":"Transformations aspect"},{"location":"aspects/typesystem/","text":"Typstem aspect \u00b6 A type system is part of a language definition assigning types to the nodes in the models written using the language.

How can I do that? Make your node implement ISuppressErrors . If you don\u2019t override any methods of it, it will suppress all constraint, typesystem and cardinality errors and warnings. You may override #suppress(node<>) to only suppress the errors of certain subnodes. You may override #suppress(NodeReportItem) to only suppress certain errors. Overriding this will take precedence of overriding #suppress(node<>) . Xou should implement only one of them or manually call #suppress(node<>) from #suppress(NodeReportItem) . If there are nested nodes that implement ISuppressErrors , the error will be suppressed if any of them returns true. You may debug such by copying the errornode to the console (e.g. nodeRef@50283 ) and running this line: 1 2 3 > nodeRef @ 50283. ancestors < concept = ISuppressErrors > . select ({ ~ it => [ it , it . suppress ( nodeRef @ 50283 ) ] ; }); [[ dummy , false ] , [< no name >[ LiteralProgramFragment ] : dummy (): void , false ] , [ Demo1 , true ]] The result is the path from that node to the top and will tell you which node is suppressing that error.

The files from operation from the MPS build model, changes the access permissions of the copied over files. As a workaround you can use Buildlayout_Filemode or unzip the files using Gradle. MPS build script \u00b6 The build-language is one of the oldest parts of MPS , designed to generate the ant files in an easier way, but it isn\u2019t refactored until today. The generator of the build language has to find out what, for example, \u201csolution needs baselanguage\u201d means at runtime-level. To execute code from the solution, the JVM needs the baselanguage.jar on the classpath. The more dependencies the solution has, the more complex becomes the generated ant file, because the generator has to consider all these transitive dependencies. The generator needs to know what artefact a module generates and how the generated artefact/module is used at runtime. Therefore, the jars must be on the classpath. The modules in the mps-groups in the MPS build script contain information from the serialized descriptors (.msd files, .mpl files, \u2026). The Reload all modules from disk intention loads them explicitly. The descriptor files aren\u2019t read before generation, so that you should always verify before you push if your MPS build scripts are up-to-date. For every dependency added to a module or a changed reexport flag, this intention has to be triggered by hand. Problem: the current implementation of the build-language isn\u2019t extensible, because it always looks into the original model. The main part of the ant file generation is the dependency analysis (for the modules), and for this it needs to access the original model for some technical reasons. These limit you to languages which are provided by MPS . You can\u2019t use your own patterns, for example, you can\u2019t write an extension which picks all modules from a folder, generates an intellij-plugin out of them and stores the result in a zip file and generates all the code required for the command-line build. But this isn\u2019t possible because of the build-language-inherent dependency analysis mechanism. The code generator of the build language has to verify for dependencies like jars in stub-models, jars at runtime etc., but the error messages aren\u2019t well-designed. For example, you have a jar file xyz.jar entered as java runtime dependency of the language abc. Instead of something like \u201cyou have to enter xyz.jar to your build layout plugin-123, cause language abc specifies it as java runtime dependency\u201d you get for example \u201cjar stub library should be extracted into build-script: ${my.project}/very/long/path/lib/xyz.jar \u201d, which isn\u2019t helpful. Many problems the generator finds could also be found by the model checker, but the checks are done at generation time and implemented as \u201cgencontext.show error\u201d in the generator. Generated ant scripts ( build.xml ) \u00b6 The mps build scripts are generated to ant scripts, which then generate the modules. The ant script starts a headless- MPS with all required dependencies, puts jars on the classpath and does some further magic. Tasks can be passed to the ant script like the \u201cgenerate\u201d task. Modules have several models with dependencies. For example, for a language, the behavior uses the structure aspect; the type-system uses the behavior aspect etc. which can result in complex dependencies between these models. These have to be considered when the models are generated and compiled. The order is derived by the code generator of the build language and results in an execution plan where the \u201ccompile units\u201d are grouped in \u201cchunks\u201d. Chunks with bootstrap-dependencies are explicitly marked, which means all modules in the chunk have to be compiled at the same time. MPS consists of hundreds of jar files which must be on the classpath for the code generation and compilation, which leads to giant ant scripts (with some thousand lines). Even simple mps build scripts, which only use BaseLanguage result into big ant scripts. The build layout in the MPS build script defines how your modules are packaged e.g. as zip containing multiple plugins, as simple plugin-folder, as lib-folder with a flat list of jars, etc. The ant script needs to know where the local MPS is installed and where your modules and dependencies are located. This is usually done using folder macros in the mps build script which are generated as \u201cproperties\u2019\u2018 in the ant script. This makes the build independent of your local machine and the ant script can be executed on the CI or any other machine. The Headless- MPS , which is started by the ant script, behaves differently in some cases compared to an IDE - MPS . For example, circular dependencies can be resolved in the IDE by just applying Make Project multiple times, which doesn\u2019t work on the command line and thus also fails on the CI. Dependencies which are visible in the IDE aren\u2019t always visible in the MPS build script/ ant script and can result in failing builds. MPS holds one big global repository, where all modules are loaded into the modules pool (project libraries, global libraries, \u2026). In the IDE everything\u2019s always visible and wrong dependencies can be resolved but on the command line the build can fail, because the referenced model isn\u2019t loaded.

Note: GitHub actions can be run locally with act . The plan is to first teach the build to open up a reachable SSH connection, and then tunnel a local port onto it so that we can connect IntelliJ to it. Sign up with ngrok and get your authtoken Since build agents usually are not reachable from the web, we\u2019ll need someone to bridge the build agents\u2019 firewalls. A common solution for that seems to be https://ngrok.com/ which requires a free signup. I tried tmate as well, but that doesn\u2019t support port forwarding. Open ssh from your .github/workflows/build.yml Lucky us, there are prepared GitHub actions that start up sshd with ngrok. I used debug-via-ssh . All we need to give it is our ngrok authtoken from above, and our public ssh key of the key that we want to use to get into the machine. Given we already have .github/workflows/build.yml , I added a step right before the failing step: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # \u2026 - name: Start SSH session uses: luchihoratiu/debug-via-ssh@main with: NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN: 2343953890afgaegaewgi\u00f6oio2332\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4 SSH_PASS: ssh-rsa AAAJOAKJFLJWKLJLEKJLEFKJLFEKJLK\u2026JAOIFJOFA bkruck@itemis.com # \u2026 Since this is a private repository, I was fine with directly pasting my authtoken and public SSH key into it directly (I didn\u2019t have permissions to add secrets to the repo). After the whole session, I reset my ngrok auth token. Another note worth mentioning is, that we trust the author of the action and ngrok here to not man-in-the-middle us here. Tell MPS to wait for us Now we can run the GitHub build and see that ngrok is stopping the build at the desired location, being ready for us to connect. In the endpoints list , our agent should be listed with a domain name and port. Taking the two, we can now ssh into it: 1 2 # SSH through ngrok onto the build machine, already forwarding local 5020 to the remote machine ssh -L 5020:localhost:5020 -p11720 runner@4.tcp.ngrok.io If you are asked for a password, fix the casing of -p . If still asked for a password, check which user is running the build. On GitHub, that user seems to be called runner right now. Even though he has sudo rights.

Besides the container runtime, Docker also includes the tools required to build preconfigured images that are then executed in the container. These images are built from a Dockerfile. Essentially, everything in the infrastructure is provisioning using docker from the teamcity frontend over the database to the build agent. For the building agent, this approach allows us to keep the building agents consistent with their installed software and their versions. The Dockerfile for our general purpose agents can be found at GitHub. The docker image build from the docker file is published to docker hub, hosting service for images, and then used in our build server. The complete docker configuration for our build server is hosted on GitLab. It also included the scripts that download/update the docker image and run the agent. Since our teamcity setup uses multiple containers, a separate container for the database or the webserver that handles the encrypted connection, we are using docker-compose as an orchestration tool.","title":"CI"},{"location":"build/ci/#continuous-integration","text":"How to attach debugger to a CI build on GitHub actions? Note: GitHub actions can be run locally with act . The plan is to first teach the build to open up a reachable SSH connection, and then tunnel a local port onto it so that we can connect IntelliJ to it. Sign up with ngrok and get your authtoken Since build agents usually are not reachable from the web, we\u2019ll need someone to bridge the build agents\u2019 firewalls. A common solution for that seems to be https://ngrok.com/ which requires a free signup. I tried tmate as well, but that doesn\u2019t support port forwarding. Open ssh from your .github/workflows/build.yml Lucky us, there are prepared GitHub actions that start up sshd with ngrok. I used debug-via-ssh . All we need to give it is our ngrok authtoken from above, and our public ssh key of the key that we want to use to get into the machine. Given we already have .github/workflows/build.yml , I added a step right before the failing step: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # \u2026 - name: Start SSH session uses: luchihoratiu/debug-via-ssh@main with: NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN: 2343953890afgaegaewgi\u00f6oio2332\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4 SSH_PASS: ssh-rsa AAAJOAKJFLJWKLJLEKJLEFKJLFEKJLK\u2026JAOIFJOFA bkruck@itemis.com # \u2026 Since this is a private repository, I was fine with directly pasting my authtoken and public SSH key into it directly (I didn\u2019t have permissions to add secrets to the repo). After the whole session, I reset my ngrok auth token. Another note worth mentioning is, that we trust the author of the action and ngrok here to not man-in-the-middle us here. Tell MPS to wait for us Now we can run the GitHub build and see that ngrok is stopping the build at the desired location, being ready for us to connect. In the endpoints list , our agent should be listed with a domain name and port. Taking the two, we can now ssh into it: 1 2 # SSH through ngrok onto the build machine, already forwarding local 5020 to the remote machine ssh -L 5020:localhost:5020 -p11720 runner@4.tcp.ngrok.io If you are asked for a password, fix the casing of -p . If still asked for a password, check which user is running the build. On GitHub, that user seems to be called runner right now. Even though he has sudo rights. We now want to teach MPS to open the debug ports and wait for us to connect before running any tests. On CLI, this doesn\u2019t work with .vmoptions files, but instead, we\u2019re running the tests from an ant-file in this project. Since the allScripts generation was already performed, we only need to open the ant-file and add a jvm argument. I like to open build/myProject/build-tests.xml with vim and then execute the following search-expression: %s/<\\/jvmargs>/ <arg value=\"-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5020\" \\/>\\r <\\/jvmargs>/g . In other terms: Look for </jvmargs> and add <arg value=\"-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5020\" \\/> right in front of it. The suspend=y will tell java to not start doing anything before we are connected, while teh address=5020 tells it to be welcoming us on port 5020. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 --- build/myProject/build-tests.xml 2021-09-17 21:15:50.000000000 +0200 +++ build/myProject/build-tests.xml.before 2021-09-17 21:32:09.000000000 +0200 @@ -342,7 +342,6 @@ <jvmargs> <arg value=\"-ea\" /> <arg value=\"-Xmx3072m\" /> - <arg value=\"-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=*:5020\" /> </jvmargs> <macro name=\"mps_home\" path=\"${mps_home}\" /> <macro name=\"myProject.home\" path=\"${myProject.home}\" /> Run the tests from within SSH Since I don\u2019t know how to move ngrok into the background while proceeding the build, I just ran the next github action by hand: 1 2 3 4 5 $ cd worker/myProject $ ./gradlew testLanguages \u2026 \u2026 Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 5020 We should now see the command line MPS start up and say that it is waiting for us on 5020 .

It will forward the requests over SSH to the agent machine. Once connected, you\u2019ll be able to set breakpoints (for example, I set an Exception breakpoint for StackOverflowError ), and then proceed the build to run into the break point.

The answer is that when MPS is initialized and a project is opened, it sets up classloaders, putts on the classpath any dependencies that module Baz might have, so that you don\u2019t have to specify them ourselves.

Fall-through: commented : write a comment why a fall-through is necessary in a switch statement. Default case is present : always write a default case for switch statements. Rules common to all identifiers : identifiers use only ASCII letters and digits, and, in a few cases noted below, underscores. Don\u2019t use prefixes or suffixes with particular meanings. For example, these names don\u2019t adhere to the style: name_ , mName , s_name and kName . Package names : package names are all lowercase, with consecutive words concatenated together (no underscores). For example, com.example.deepspace , not com.example.deepSpace or com.example.deep_space . Class names : should be in UpperCamelCase. Class names are typically nouns or noun phrases. For example, Character or ImmutableList . Interface names may also be nouns or noun phrases (for example, List ), but may sometimes be adjectives or adjective phrases instead (for example, Readable ). Test classes should start with the name of the class they\u2019re testing, and ending with Test. For example, HashTest or HashIntegrationTest . Method names : should be in lowerCamelCase. Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases. For example: sendMessage or stop . Underscores may appear in JUnit test method names to separate logical components of the name, with each component written in lowerCamelCase. One typical pattern is _ , for example pop_emptyStack . No correct way exists for naming test methods. Constant names : use all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore Non-constant field names : non-constant field names (static or otherwise) should be lowerCamelCase . These names are typically nouns or noun phrases. For example, computedValues or index . Parameter names should be lowerCamelCase . One-character parameter names in public methods should be avoided. Local variable names should be in lowerCamelCase. Even when final and immutable, local variables are not considered to be constants, and should not be styled as constants. Type variable names : each type variable should adhere to one of two styles: a single capital letter, optionally followed by a single numeral (such as E , T , X , T2 ) or a name in the form used for classes, followed by the capital letter T (examples: RequestT , FooBarT ).

Search the forum and issue tracker . Ask a question on Slack . I changed something in a settings page and nothing changed. There might be a bug related to caching. Reopening the dialog, invalidating the cache or restarting the project might help. Which standard IDE settings should you change? The maximum heap size setting should be changed to a higher values such as 8 GB when using many languages or plugins. Another reason for high memory usage can be many (poorly) implemented checking rules. I am running low on memory or the IDE is running slow. What can you do without restarting MPS ? When you have enabled the loaded models indicator in the lower right corner of the screen, you can click on the text to unload not needed models .

Specific Languages blog: Ambiguous terms: Modules and models What\u2019s a SRepository and how\u2019s it structured? The answer can be found in the MPS source code .Multiple repositories could be available in the feature. Given a repository, references to modules/models/nodes can be resolved. There\u2019s no need in making ids unique globally as each subsystem knows, which exact repository it needs to use at any moment. (e.g. the type-system knows where it stores its type-nodes, so it will not try to resolve references to them ) A repository contains modules, modules have model roots, each model root can load models. Also a module can be a models container itself (without model root). A model is then a set of root nodes. Each root node is a root of a tree of nodes, So that overall, a repository is a tree structure. Is there an existing expression/scripting language? There is the expressions sample project.

Specific Languages blog: Why is my project suddenly read-only? How do you work with more than one project in MPS ? Given I want to work on a MPS project that uses other projects and I want to switch between tasks that sometimes need changes on both, in the dependent project and the root project. I would like to switch back and forth between using the default prepackaged project dependencies and my own repository of them where I build them myself. How could I do that? Option 0 : Open multiple projects in MPS at the same time Works when doing small changes fast unreliable: when changing dependencies in my source models, this leads to a reload operation on the repository, which sometimes messes up the loaded repository and caches Option 1 : Publish and pull from local maven ( IETS3 ) reliable example gradle script needs to be told to pull from local repository \u2013 e.g. by providing -PforceLocalDependencies to IETS3 \u2013 or use dependency overrides Option 3 : Changing project libraries does not affect command line builds Option 3a : Command line setup Task ( IETS3 ) We usually have a ./gradlew setup task in our projects that replaces your .mps/libraries.xml . When you want to change the project, you\u2019ll need to change the configuration of that command line setup task and rerun it. Option 3b : MPS Path variables in settings (deprecated) In the MPS setttings, you can configure path variables that can be used in .mps/libraries.xml to pinpoint to the location of a target project. They will only configure the MPS behavior and not affect the command line builds. So in most cases, you don\u2019t want to use them and instead let your build script setup these files. contributed by: @abstraktor Why is MPS shipped with JBR instead of using an installed JDK / JRE ?

Are MPS language often used as plugins in Intellij IDEs instead of MPS itself? (an IntelliJ IDEA plugin, not custom RCP ) No, this functionality is not used very often. How can you find plugins on the JetBrains marketplace that are usable in MPS ? Searching for the word MPS in all categories should do the trick. Why do many IntelliJ plugins don\u2019t work with MPS ? Many of these plugins operate on lines in a text editor. MPS uses projectional editors which are not normal text editors. It doesn\u2019t use documents and the PSI because MPS models are not text based. Using plugins that are not developed for MPS can interfere with certain features of MPS (e.g. find usages isn\u2019t working anymore). Are there any general purpose plugins for MPS from the community? Have a look at the plugin section of mps.rocks . Which kinds of plugins are there?

Hardcoded parts of MPS can\u2019t be translated. There are also known bugs with extented characters ( MPS -31835 ) and unicode in general in case you want to use special characters. Further information can be found in this article: Localizing an IntelliJ Plugin . Can you get information about a MPS installation via an HTTP request? Yes, this is possible through the IntelliJ Platform REST API : Send a GET request (or enter it into the browser address bar): http://localhost:63342/api/about?more=true . Make sure that you don\u2019t have IntelliJ opened at the same time as it has the same API.

Remove the plugin that contains the preference page. For SPreference pages: they are project plugins, so you can find them through ProjectPluginManager . getPlugins and then call dispose or you could unregister the preference pages itself. For example: 1 2 3 4 Project ideaProject = ProjectPluginManager . getInstance ( ProjectHelper . toIdeaProject ( # project ); list < BaseProjectPlugin > plugins = new arraylist < BaseProjectPlugin > ( copy : ideaProject . getPlugins ()); BaseProjectPrefsComponent component = plugins . findFirst ({ ~ it => it . toString (). startsWith ( \"path_to_your._ProjectPlugin\" ); }). getPrefsComponents () get ( 0 ); component . getPages (). get ( 0 ). unregister (); For preference forms: they can be found through Configurable .

Given I want to know, which version of IntelliJ Community my MPS is built from. How can I know? mbeddr : The easiest way to get the correct platform for an MPS version is by running ant in the root of your MPS sources: ant -f build/getDependencies.xml download-platform It will place the platform in the folder mps-platform of the repository and is automatically imported into the intelliJ project where you can read the sources and also step into them when debugging. In case you\u2019re looking at an RCP : /build.number provides this information and more, eg idea.platform.build.number=MPS\u2014203.7717.56 . The platform version is part of the build information e.g. MPS \u2014211.7442.1291 To get the baseline version e.g. 211, programatically: ApplicationInfo . getInstance (). getBuild (). getBaselineVersion () To get the full version e.g. 211.7442.1291, programatically: ApplicationInfo . getInstance (). getBuild (). currentVersion (). asString () How can you show a custom implemented project view instead of the MPS logical view?

For example, consider the following code: Single dispatch 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 public class SpaceShip { public string GetShipType () { return \"SpaceShip\" ; } } public class ApolloSpacecraft extends SpaceShip { public string GetShipType () { return \"ApolloSpacecraft\" ; } } SpaceShip ship = new ApolloSpacecraft (); System . out . println ( ship . GetShipType ()); // output: (1) ApolloSpacecraft The actual method implementation which should be called, is chosen at runtime based solely on the actual type of ship. So, only the type of single object is used to select the method, hence the name single dispatch. Note: Single dispatch is one form of dynamic dispatch , for example, the method is chosen at runtime. If the method is chosen at compile time (true for all non-virtual methods), it\u2019s called static dispatch . Now add some asteroids: Double dispatch 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 public class Asteroid { public void collideWith ( SpaceShip s ) { System . out . println ( \"Asteroid hit a SpaceShip\" ); } public void collideWith ( ApolloSpacecraft a ) { System . out . println ( \"Asteroid hit an ApolloSpacecraft\" ); } } public class ExplodingAsteroid extends Asteroid { public void collideWith ( SpaceShip s ) { System . out . println ( \"ExplodingAsteroid hit a SpaceShip\" ); } public void collideWith ( ApolloSpacecraft a ) { System . out . println ( \"ExplodingAsteroid hit an ApolloSpacecraft\" ); } } public class DoubleDispatch { public static void main ( string [] args ) { Asteroid theAsteroid = new Asteroid (); SpaceShip theSpaceShip = new SpaceShip (); ApolloSpacecraft theApolloSpacecraft = new ApolloSpacecraft (); theAsteroid . collideWith ( theSpaceShip ); // output: (1) theAsteroid . collideWith ( theApolloSpacecraft ); // output: (2) System . out . println (); ExplodingAsteroid theExplodingAsteroid = new ExplodingAsteroid (); theExplodingAsteroid . collideWith ( theSpaceShip ); // output: (3) theExplodingAsteroid . collideWith ( theApolloSpacecraft ); // output: (4) System . out . println (); Asteroid theAsteroidReference = theExplodingAsteroid ; theAsteroidReference . collideWith ( theSpaceShip ); // output: (5) theAsteroidReference . collideWith ( theApolloSpacecraft ); // output: (6) System . out . println (); // Note the different datatypes SpaceShip theSpaceShipReference = theApolloSpacecraft ; theAsteroid . collideWith ( theSpaceShipReference ); // output: (7) theAsteroidReference . collideWith ( theSpaceShipReference ); // output: (8) } } Asteroid hit a SpaceShip Asteroid hit an ApolloSpacecraft Exploding Asteroid hit a SpaceShip Exploding Asteroid hit anApolloSpacecraft Exploding Asteroid hit a SpaceShip Exploding Asteroid hit an ApolloSpacecraft Asteroid hit an ApolloSpacecraft ExplodingAsteroid hit a SpaceShip The desired result here would be ExplodingAsteroid hit an ApolloSpacecraft but instead you get ExplodingAsteroid hit a SpaceShip . To support double dispatch, import the dispatch language and include dispatch modifiers in ExplodingAsteroid: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 public class ExplodingAsteroid extends Asteroid { public dispatch void collideWith ( SpaceShip s ) { System . out . println ( \"ExplodingAsteroid hit a SpaceShip\" ); } public dispatch void collideWith ( ApolloSpacecraft a ) { System . out . println ( \"ExplodingAsteroid hit an ApolloSpacecrat\" ); } } The last method now correctly returns ExplodingAsteroid hit an ApolloSpacecraft .","title":"Double dispatch"},{"location":"languages/mps_extensions/","text":"Checkboxes \u00b6 Boolean checkboxes \u00b6 de.itemis.mps.editor.bool A boolean checkbox cell that provides custom icons for states.

The guide was written some years ago, so it might not reflect the workflow and guidelines of newer committers anymore. Commit messages \u00b6 In general, try to follow this guide with some exceptions for minor changes: When you commit a major change that relates to a GitHub issue, start your commit message with a short title (less than 50 char). Ideally, it contains the title of the GitHub issue if it fits. If you can\u2019t fit the issue title, please reference the issue ID with #4711 notation in the title. The title is followed by a short optional paragraph (not longer than 80 chars) describing the change: 1 2 3 ClassCastException on FilteringActionManager #1207 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. In contrast, if your commit is just a minor fix, then you mention the modified mbeddr subsystem (for example mpsutil: , core: or ext: ) and provide a short description, followed by a short optional paragraph (not longer than 80 chars) describing the change: 1 2 3 core,ext: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. The optional paragraph at the end of your commit message contains further information about the change. Tests were added or describe why the fix was necessary, maybe there are special conditions when the issue surfaces. This is also the place where you can put GitHub issue commands to close or reference other issues. Further information and ideas on how to write good commit messages can be found here and here Branches \u00b6 We make heavy use of branches in the development process. If your task requires more than one commit, commit your changes on a branch. Two types of branches exist: feature and refactor : the first is used for new features, the second for bug fixes or code refactorings. They are distinguished by prefix: a feature branch my-awesome-stuff would be named feature/my-awesome-stuff or refactor/my-awesome-stuff , if it\u2019s a refactoring branch. Both kinds of branches should be short living (a couple of days) to reduce the risk of diverting to far from master and causing huge afford to merge. Ideally, no commits happen directly to master and every commit is first evaluated on a feature/refactoring branch. Note: Nowadays we mostly do merging instead of rebasing. The following sections might therefore not accurately reflect the current workflow. Merging \u00b6 Once your work is done, it needs to be integrated into the master branch. Because your branch most likely diverted from master, merging it into master would normally end up with a merge commit on the master branch. We have learned the hard way that merging clutters Git history and makes all intermediate commits of the branch end up in master. To prevent this, the suggested workflow is to rebase your branch onto master and thereby squash all your commits into a single one. Example \u00b6 This example shows you how to integrate your branch into the master branch by using rebase instead of merge. The list of commands to use is: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 git fetch git rebase -i origin/master git checkout origin/master git pull git merge --ff-only feature/my-awesome-stuff git pull --rebase git push They are all explained below. Below you can see the starting point in the repository: 1 2 * 1ed51e3 (HEAD -> master) added another file * 5cee848 initial commit Now create the new feature branch named feature/my-awesome-stuff and commit some changes on it. While working on your branch, someone else committed changes into the master branch. Hence, for integrating your changes into master you would end up with a merge: 1 2 3 4 5 6 * 3c36424 (HEAD -> master) fixed some super important issue | * 66beba4 (feature/my-awesome-stuff) more work on my awesome feature | * cca995e did some stuff |/ * 1ed51e3 added another file * 5cee848 initial commit To get your commits into master , first make sure that your local history is up-to-date by running git fetch . Next, rebase your commits. This prevents a merge from happening. This is achieved with the following git command on our branch: git rebase -i origin/master . Git will now ask you how to proceed with your commits: 1 2 pick cca995e did some stuff pick 66beba4 more work on my awesome feature Now squash all commits into a single commit while rebasing: 1 2 pick cca995e did some stuff squash 66beba4 more work on my awesome feature Afterward, Git asks you to enter a message for the new commit. The default message it offers is a concatenation of all the commit messages from the commits to squash. However, you want to make the new commit message fit the earlier described pattern. After rebasing your Git history looks like this: 1 2 3 4 * afc0fb5 (HEAD -> feature/my-awesome-stuff) 42: super awesome feature * 3c36424 (master) fixed some super important issue * 1ed51e3 added another file * 5cee848 initial commit You still have to branch; now it\u2019s time to merge them. Change your git branch to master using git checkout origin/master . Make sure you have pulled from the remote and your branch is up-to-date. Now run git merge --ff-only feature/my-awesome-stuff . The \u2013ff-only is important to force git to not merge if it would produce a merge commit. Now Git history looks like this: 1 2 3 4 * afc0fb5 (HEAD -> master, feature/my-awesome-stuff) 42: super awesome feature * 3c36424 fixed some super important issue * 1ed51e3 added another file * 5cee848 initial commit You haven\u2019t created a merge commit, and all commits from your branch appear as a single commit in the Git history. You are good to go to push back to the repo. But wait, what if somebody has changes things in the meantime on the remote, wouldn\u2019t the pull create a new merge? Yes it would! Therefor don\u2019t use a plain git pull but use git pull --rebase in case you are pulling from the repo into your local master branch. This way, Git doesn\u2019t produce a new merge commit but rebase your local changes on top of the remote changes. Test Organization \u00b6 Naming \u00b6 The test solution for language com.mbeddr.x.lang should be named test.com.mbeddr.x.lang . Respectively, the test solution for solution com.mbeddr.y.sol should be named test.com.mbeddr.y.sol . If you need a dedicated language for testing purposes, you should name it test.com.mbeddr.x.[lang|sol].testsupport (or a similar suffix). This way, you can discriminate between \u201creal\u201d code below namespace com.mbeddr and test code below namespace test . You should also place any demo or playground modules outside the com.mbeddr namespace for the same reason. By following this scheme, you can build productive code in the UI by building everything below com.mbeddr in the modules pool, and be assured not to be interfered by test, demo, or playground code. Project Structure \u00b6 All languages, solutions, tests, demos, and playgrounds of one feature should be placed below a common virtual folder bearing the name of the feature. An exception might be build models. Generators must be present only when required or deleted if empty. This allows us to access all artifacts constituting one feature. File System \u00b6 All test code should be placed in a special folder in the file system: Build \u00b6 Build script setup \u00b6 In mbeddr there are different build scripts. They are used on the local machines for building the languages and on the build server for various build-related tasks, such as testing or packaging. This documentation guides you in following the mbeddr standards for setting up your BuildProject and integrating it into Mbeddr\u2019s build infrastructure. Required BuildFolderMacros \u00b6 In your BuildProject (the build script\u2019s model representation in MPS ) you first need a BuildFolderMacro (a folder ) named mps.home (see code snippet below). If you want to run the generated ant script in your MPS , then you should specify the location of your MPS installation in a relative way, otherwise you don\u2019t need a path for mps.home . At script execution time, you will redefine mps.home , to point to the folder where your MPS installation is located at. 1 folder mps.home = <no defaultPath> Next, you need a BuildFolderMacro named artifacts.root that doesn\u2019t require a path (see snippet below). When executing the ant script, generated from your BuildProject , define this macro from outside to point to the folder where all your plugin dependencies (for example: mbeddr.platform ) are located. 1 folder artifacts.root = <no defaultPath> For each BuildProjectDependency (the dependency\u2019s section below your folders) we need a separate BuildFolderMacro that follows the naming convention .artifacts and points to $artifacts.root/<BuildProject name> . At build script execution time, those macros will point to the folders, where your required plugins are located. In the code snippet below you can see the resulting BuildFolderMacros for a BuildProject with two dependencies: mps-sl-all and com.mbeddr.platform. 1 2 folder sl-all.artifacts = $artifacts.root/mps-sl-all folder platform.artifacts = $artifacts.root/com.mbeddr.platform Type system tests \u00b6 When you want to build type system tests that require a specific path macro (for example: for specifying the project location inside your TestInfo ), then you must create a BuildFolderMacro for this path macro. The name of this BuildFolderMacro should start with mps.macro , followed by the name of the respective path macro. In the example below, you instruct MPS via mps.macro.mbeddr.github.core.home to create a path macro mbeddr.github.core.home that points to the relative path location specified in the other BuildFolderMacro mbeddr.github.core.home . 1 folder mps.macro.mbeddr.github.core.home = $mbeddr.github.core.home Furthermore, you need to mark solutions containing type system tests as content: (with sources and tests) . To achieve this, please perform the following steps: Inside your BuildProject move your cursor to the solution that contains your type system tests. Open the inspector. Inside the Inspector select the node sources, open the context menu and select sources and tests from it. To get your tests executed, you first need to add the module-tests plugin to your use plugins: section (on top of your BuildProject ). When you can\u2019t add the node module-tests to this section, import it from jetbrains.mps.build.mps.tests.accessories . Finally, create a BuildMpsLayout_TestModules (a test configuration ) at bottom of your BuildProject and list there all solutions that contain type system tests to be executed. Configurations for generator and compiler \u00b6 To make sure code is generated and compiled the same way as in MPS , you have to add the following configurations ( BuildSource_JavaOptions and BuildMps_GeneratorOptions ) to your BuildProject \u2018s project structure. Those configurations control the generator engine and the Java compiler to make sure we have the same build behavior as in the IDE . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 generator options <project default> strict mode true multiple threads true number of threads 4 inplace transform true hide warnings false resort to static references true java options <project default> generate debug info true generate no warnings false fork false compiler <default compiler> java compliance level 1.6 java compiler options <no additional options> copy resources false Building a release \u00b6 For preparing a mbeddr release, you can modify the version number that is set for the mbeddr plugins by overwriting the values of major.version , minor.version and build (see screenshot below). However, you don\u2019t change these values inside the MPS build scripts, instead, either you change them in the global gradle script ( mbeddr.core/build.gradle ), or you overwrite them via the command line while spawning a new release build: -PmajorVersion=1 -PbuildVersion=0 -PminorVersion=0000 build_mbeddr publishMbeddrAllInOnePublicationToMavenRepository","title":"Development guide"},{"location":"mbeddr/development_guide/#development-guide","text":"This document describes how the mbeddr team uses Git for contributing changes.

If your task requires more than one commit, commit your changes on a branch. Two types of branches exist: feature and refactor : the first is used for new features, the second for bug fixes or code refactorings. They are distinguished by prefix: a feature branch my-awesome-stuff would be named feature/my-awesome-stuff or refactor/my-awesome-stuff , if it\u2019s a refactoring branch. Both kinds of branches should be short living (a couple of days) to reduce the risk of diverting to far from master and causing huge afford to merge.

Because your branch most likely diverted from master, merging it into master would normally end up with a merge commit on the master branch.

To prevent this, the suggested workflow is to rebase your branch onto master and thereby squash all your commits into a single one.","title":"Merging"},{"location":"mbeddr/development_guide/#example","text":"This example shows you how to integrate your branch into the master branch by using rebase instead of merge. The list of commands to use is: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 git fetch git rebase -i origin/master git checkout origin/master git pull git merge --ff-only feature/my-awesome-stuff git pull --rebase git push They are all explained below. Below you can see the starting point in the repository: 1 2 * 1ed51e3 (HEAD -> master) added another file * 5cee848 initial commit Now create the new feature branch named feature/my-awesome-stuff and commit some changes on it. While working on your branch, someone else committed changes into the master branch. Hence, for integrating your changes into master you would end up with a merge: 1 2 3 4 5 6 * 3c36424 (HEAD -> master) fixed some super important issue | * 66beba4 (feature/my-awesome-stuff) more work on my awesome feature | * cca995e did some stuff |/ * 1ed51e3 added another file * 5cee848 initial commit To get your commits into master , first make sure that your local history is up-to-date by running git fetch . Next, rebase your commits. This prevents a merge from happening. This is achieved with the following git command on our branch: git rebase -i origin/master . Git will now ask you how to proceed with your commits: 1 2 pick cca995e did some stuff pick 66beba4 more work on my awesome feature Now squash all commits into a single commit while rebasing: 1 2 pick cca995e did some stuff squash 66beba4 more work on my awesome feature Afterward, Git asks you to enter a message for the new commit. The default message it offers is a concatenation of all the commit messages from the commits to squash. However, you want to make the new commit message fit the earlier described pattern. After rebasing your Git history looks like this: 1 2 3 4 * afc0fb5 (HEAD -> feature/my-awesome-stuff) 42: super awesome feature * 3c36424 (master) fixed some super important issue * 1ed51e3 added another file * 5cee848 initial commit You still have to branch; now it\u2019s time to merge them. Change your git branch to master using git checkout origin/master . Make sure you have pulled from the remote and your branch is up-to-date. Now run git merge --ff-only feature/my-awesome-stuff . The \u2013ff-only is important to force git to not merge if it would produce a merge commit. Now Git history looks like this: 1 2 3 4 * afc0fb5 (HEAD -> master, feature/my-awesome-stuff) 42: super awesome feature * 3c36424 fixed some super important issue * 1ed51e3 added another file * 5cee848 initial commit You haven\u2019t created a merge commit, and all commits from your branch appear as a single commit in the Git history. You are good to go to push back to the repo. But wait, what if somebody has changes things in the meantime on the remote, wouldn\u2019t the pull create a new merge? Yes it would! Therefor don\u2019t use a plain git pull but use git pull --rebase in case you are pulling from the repo into your local master branch.

How can you make an internal MPS editor read-only? Given I want to make a contribution to a generator the j.mps.lang.editor . When I download the MPS source , open the project in MPS under code and open j.m.l.editor/SubstituteMenuPart_ReferenceScope_declare , then I see the model being read-only. What can I do? You need to open MPS in IDEA (Community Edition is enough), compile and run it from there, then you can edit MPS sources. There are instructions in README . How can you do a fulltext search in the IDE ? I sometimes need a textual search which MPS doesn\u2019t provide out of the box. In that situation, I am unsure of the concept and type of what I see, so a top-down search is not an option. Instead I would like to search for that string to have a starting point for my investigation. Examples: I want to investigate in an editor in the user interface and don\u2019t want to reverse engineer what hints, editors and concepts lead to what I see. Behavioral view code, like custom cells, swing cells or querylists make it hard to figure out where the source logic of that is located. when the console shows something I don\u2019t understand, I\u2019d like to see its context source code, so that I can figure out what to do next. Option 0 : Use Language Debugging facilities of MPS instead. For built-in languages, MPS brings a load of dedicated debugging facilities: Debugging editor cells and nodes: When you right-click an item in the editor, you can find a submenu Language Debug . Debugging menu entries: Select an item that you\u2019re curious in and press Cmd + Alt + B / Ctrl + Alt + B to open the Menu Trace of it. Setup and an IntelliJ and connect it to step through java code. Option 1 : Search for literals from console. Option 2 : Search through serialized Java. Set up IntelliJ with your project. Hit Cmd + Shift + F / Ctrl + Shift + F to search in path. When you found a class of interest, open it in MPS via Cmd + N / Ctrl + N . The source node usually has a similar name. This is great for finding editor nodes, for example, if that java class is named Vehicle_EditorBuilder , your source node was an editor for the Vehicle concept. Last Resort : Search XML model directly. Use this only if you have no assembly and your project doesn\u2019t open. The serialized API is subject to change and using this should be the last barrier. Then use ack (or a similar tool) on the command line to find the relevant models that contain this string. The output even contains the node id though, as in this example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 $ ack \"ack com.mbeddr.mpsutil.grammarcells\" \u2026 <node concept=\"3bR9La\" id=\"1aL6sVX49Cb\" role=\"1SiIV1\"> <property role=\"3bR36h\" value=\"false\" /> <ref role=\"3bR37D\" to=\"90a9:F1NWDqq_DA\" resolve=\"com.mbeddr.mpsutil.grammarcells.runtime\" /> </node> \u2026 Use new IdEncoder (). parseNodeId ( \"1aL6sVX49Cb\" ) to get the node id. This will print the corresponding node to console. Clicking it will open in in MPS : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 # nodes . where ({ ~ it => boolean equals = false ; try { equals = it / . getNodeId (). equals ( new IdEncoder (). parseNodeId ( \"1aL6sVX49Cb\" )); } catch ( Exception e ) { < no statements > } return equals ; }) How to get rid of Error: shall specify a repository to lock? When accessing model properties in rendering code, you must encapsulate the model accessing code in a read action: It always has an error \u201cError: shall specify a repository to lock\u201d. How can I get rid of it? What is a \u2018repository\u2019 and is there any documentation that explains the concept and how to use it correctly? asked by: @cwalesch The repository is what is represented as the \u201cmodules pool\u201d in the UI . It contains all the dependencies currently visible. At the moment there is only one global repository which causes several problems. MPS is slowly but steadily moving to project specific repositories. That would mean each project (window) of MPS would have it\u2019s own separate repository. To get the repository you will need access to the project. e.g. the editor context will give you access to the repository: editorContext.getRepository() . In other cases, for instance, when you don\u2019t have an editor context directly available you need to make sure that from UI (action) you pass the project or repository though to the place where you need it. answered by: @coolya How can you get an identifier of a node? Given I have a node myNode and I need to serialize something that identifies it. When I serialize that something and then deserialize that identifier again, then I will find exactly that node. How can I build such a thing? Option 1 : PersistenceFacade ID Since the url does not look nice; you may use this combined string of model ID and node ID that is used for the url. For that, import the class org.jetbrains.mps.openapi.persistence.PersistenceFacade from the MPS .OpenApi stub and run: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # serialize identifier string mySerializedId = SNodePointer . serialize ( node / . getReference ()) # find node based on serialized identifier node <> myFoundNode = SNodePointer . deserialize ( mySerializedId ). resolve ( repository ) # then , node == myFoundNode Option 2 : Url Import the httpsupport language and use node.getURL . This will be a url that you can use locally to open this node. It includes the node id and the model and thus is a pretty good globally unique id. This id is a local URL and looks odd though: http://127.0.0.1:63320/node?ref=r%3A4bc03cd1-b1e3-49da-84da-f27e7062f6f7%28integrityOfUpdate%29%2F2209769512593382448&project=SecurityAnalyst . Especially the code to find the node again based on this url contains some grepping then. Option 3 : Node Id Use node / . getNodeId (). toString () it will yield the nodes id. Note that a node ID is only unique within this model. If it should be globally unique, consider option 1. contributed by: @abstraktor Where does MPS store preferences?

Solution 1 \u00b6 Create a solution MySolution . Create a model ending with \u201c.plugin,\u201d for example MySolution.plugin . Add the language jetbrains.mps.lang.plugin.standalone to both the MySolution.plugin model and the MySolution solution. Create a StandalonePluginDescriptor in the model MySolution.plugin . Add the MySolution to a build model named MySolution.build . Create an idea plugin the build model with id MySolution.IdeaPlugin . Add MySolution.build to the idea plugin MySolution.IdeaPlugin content. Add the dependency on git4idea to MySolution.IdeaPlugin dependencies. Execute the build script. In properties of solution MySolution , on the Facets tab, select Idea Plugin . In newly appearing Idea Plugin tab, set plugin ID to MySolution.IdeaPlugin . Restart MPS . Now the classes within git4idea are available within MySolution . Attention: MPS IDE won\u2019t build the code within solution MySolution anymore. Run the build script to activate any changes.

Module class loaders can reload classes after rebuilding and are resilient towards hot reloading.

It describes both the expected state and all bugs deviating from the expectations. Overview \u00b6 The module pool has all content known to MPS . The modules pool is filled from modules in the current project and all non-project sources . MPS in general cares about dependencies between modules. The dependencies on models only constrain further the dependencies of the modules. Two main types of relations exist: dependencies are needed for any reference to something in another module. Used Languages are needed to use something defined in a language. We refer to relations if we address both types. Other types of dependencies on modules include: Java stubs (in combination with Java libraries ), Java source stubs (in combination with Java source paths ), runtime solutions and accessory models (only available for languages), and languages engaged on generation . Build models abstract Ant files to build and package modules and IDEA plugins . They contain a copy of the relations defined in the modules, and dependencies to other build models and IDEA plugins. MPS Plugins \u00b6 MPS Plugins are automatically loaded according to the solution Kind set in Java module settings. MPS Plugins need to be contained in MPS plugin models. StandalonePluginDescriptor \u00b6 We need to add a StandalonePluginDescriptor (defined in Language jetbrains.mps.lang.plugin.standalone ) as a root node if a MPS plugin model uses any concept from the language jetbrains.mps.lang.plugin . Other concepts from the language jetbrains.mps.lang.plugin.standalone don\u2019t need a StandalonePluginDescriptor . Plugin disambiguation \u00b6 The term \u201cplugin\u201d is used at various places throughout MPS . It describes different things: IDEA plugins: a packaged set of contributions to the IntelliJ IDEA platform, which MPS is based upon. MPS plugins: automatically loaded Models. Plugin language aspect: model inside a aanguage defining extension points. Build model plugins: part of the build model language providing new entries for build models. Non-project sources \u00b6 Non-project sources are global libraries IDEA plugins project libraries common and Java module settings regarding Java classes and Java source files IDEA plugins referenced by a module These directories or jar files are recursively scanned for .mpl (languages), .msd (solutions), and .devkit (devkit) files. If found, the corresponding content is added to the modules pool. Java classpath versus relations \u00b6 The various settings on models and modules specify both the Java classpath and the relations of a model. However, these settings affect classpath and relations in a different way. As a rule of thumb, the classpath has all Java classes reachable through any kind of relation. The Classpath is populated generously. On the contrary, the relations are populated reluctantly, for example, they need to be specified explicitly. The dependency relations on modules and models are completely separated from the used language relations on modules and models. Thus, no dependency requires a Used Language or vice versa. Used languages \u00b6 No implicitly Used Languages are available except described for generators. Specifically, if LanguageB has an Extends Scope dependency on LanguageA and ModuleC uses LanguageB , LanguageA isn\u2019t a Used Language within ModuleC . You must add LanguageA (containing ConceptA ) to ModuleB\u2019s and contained ModelB\u2019s used languages if and only if ModelB instantiates ConceptA within the IDE . ModelB executes intentions from LanguageA . ModelB requires type checks from LanguageA . ModelB uses editors from LanguageA by selecting an editor hint but not if LanguageA only defines the editor hint. ModuleB is a generator and outputs instance of ConceptA . Executed generators \u00b6 GeneratorA contained in LanguageA (containing ConceptA ) will be executed for ModelS (contained in ModuleS ) if and only if ModelS uses LanguageA and contains an instance of ConceptA ModelS lists LanguageA in Languages engaged on generation The preceding conditions match LanguageB containing GeneratorB extending GeneratorA For discussion, we establish a continued scenario: (The Relations listed here are not complete in order to reduce clutter. The complete example is available.) SolutionBase doesn\u2019t change during generation, as LanguageBase doesn\u2019t define any generators. SolutionBaseGen doesn\u2019t change during generation either, as it doesn\u2019t contain any instances from LanguageBaseGen , thus removing LanguageBaseGen from the list of applicable generators, ending up with no generators at all. SolutionBaseGen2 ends up with a transformed NodeBase , as Languages engaged in generation are never removed. SolutionBaseGenExtends ends up with an unchanged NodeBase , but a transformed NodeBase2 . GeneratorBaseExtends gets executed, because LanguageBaseGenExtends is listed in Languages engaged in generation . However, the Dependencies of the Language aren\u2019t considered for selecting the running Generators. In SolutionBaseGenExtends2 both NodeBase and NodeBase2 will be transformed, as LanguageBaseGenExtends2 is listed in Languages engaged in generation and GeneratorBaseExtends2 extends GeneratorBase . Only NodeExtendsGen will be transformed in SolutionExtendsGen , as the only active Generator is GeneratorExtendsGen . The reason is that we found an instance of ConceptExtendsGen contained in the same language as the generator. The Generator doesn\u2019t extend any other applicable Generator. All nodes within SolutionExtendsGen2 get transformed, as an instance of ConceptExtendsGen2 was found, and the generator GeneratorExtendsGen2 contained in the same language extends GeneratorBase . Generated relations \u00b6 Relations on the output model are defined only by the contents of the output model that was created by the generator. Thus, all languages providing the concepts of generated instances are listed in Used Languages all models referenced from the output model are listed in the dependencies Extra relations on anything else (source module, source model, dependencies of the source model, languages used in the source model, dependencies of applied generators, languages used in applied Generators) are not added to the output model. Implicit dependencies apply as described. Tests \u00b6 Tests are regular or extended JUnit tests that can be executed within MPS or stand-alone. Test models contain tests, defined by the @tests stereotype. The Stereotype enables the Run Tests entry in the solution and test model context menu. Build language test instruction to search the model for tests. As soon as you are using any concepts from language jetbrains.mps.lang.test , you need to have a TestInfo root node in the same model. The TestInfo node needs to refer to a project to be used to execute the tests. This reference may not use a ${module} , ${language_descriptor} , ${solution_descriptor} , or ${project} builtin path variables. It needs to refer to a project containing the test.","title":"General"},{"location":"mps_internal/deps_and_classpath/#dependencies-and-classpath-in-mps","text":"This page describes the meaning and effect of different types of dependencies within MPS , including the effects on the applicable Java classpath.

Make also sure to provide different colors for different color schemes (e.g. darcula theme vs light theme). Bad example #1 Bad example #2 Bold and underline aren\u2019t used together. This is an anti-pattern. More information can be found in this article . MPS related summary: Bold important phrases highlighting keywords Italic/Emphasis Used to highlight quotes (some use blockquotes). Foreign words. Underline Used for links CAPS Used for acronyms You use buttons correctly. (Swing) Buttons use appropriate symbols/text to make clear what they do. Buttons can alse be used as up and down keys. Buttons can also be hidden to not disrupt the text editing: Add option to hide buttons (checkbox, editor hint, action, etc.). Clickable elements appear clickable. When elements are clickable, they should appear clickable: They should use an indicator or different style (e.g. underlines and blue or styled like a button). You align collections when possible. Alignment is an important aspect in design ( introduction ). Use vertical grids instead of vertical collections to align cells nicely. It is also very important for readability. You use color for emphasis and to convey information. Not only bold font can be used to emphasize words but also color. Make sure that the used color is correctly associated by the user. Bad example Greyscale editor + grey is associated with disabled content/meta information such as comments. Good example Color is used to distinguish different language features: BLUE for numbers, lila/green for CONSTANTS. You use labels in a consistent way. Labels should be used consistently in the design (e.g. always bold, colon after label), the same goes for key value pairs. There is no best practise for the separation between label and text. Some ideas and common guidelines can be found here . The context of UI elements is consistent. Counterexample: There are 3 buttons next to each other that look similar: One opens an external documentation, the other navigates to a root node and the third one undos a change. This could be confusing and frustrating for the user. A default empty statement exists. There should always be a default concept that acts as an empty line or empty text. It should be editable and support autocompletion. They should have an indicator that they are editable. The easist way is to provide a placeholder value. Bad example Different groups are distinguishable from each other. Groups can be separated for example by whitespace, by drawing a border (box) or drawing brackets around the content. You emphasize non-standard operations/literals. Emphasize special operations or literals to make it clear that they are not. Another good examples in baselanguage are extension methods. Enough paddings surround elements. Make sure there is enough space between the content and its border (padding) otherwhise the editor looks too packed. More information from a design perspective can be found here . You use existing stylesheets. For baselanguage there is BaseLanguageStyle . You can search globally for instances of Stylesheet to find more styles. The font size conveys hierarchy. More information can be found in this beginner\u2019s guide to typographic hierarchy . Example hierarchy (source: Font Size And Weight Matters ) : You use the full window with for your editor. Often times the space in editor components is not good used and a lot of space is left empty on the right side of the window. This can be improved by using multiple groups next to each other or using the right hand side of the screen for some sort of legend for graphics or meta information about the (root) node (e.g. code review). Headers follow general UI principles. The following principles should be followed: hierarchical relationship of ideas consistency readability specificity More information can be found in Technical writing essentials - Headings . Headers are distinguishable from content. Bad example The header and the start of the child concepts use bold font and the same text. In this example the text \u201cOutput\u201d is redundant. The header should be larger in size. A common layout is header-input-output: At the top is the header, then there are the inputs/declarations, followed by the output/body. Make sure to separated this three groups in some ways (such as horizontal lines or empty lines). Mixed example Lines aren\u2019t too thick and not textual. A good maximum width for borders and other lines is 3 pixels. This is just a rough guideline but with thicker lines the design becomes overwhelming. Bad example You don\u2019t emphasize meta/not important information. Good example A smaller font, light gray color or maybe a different font seems to work well. Inherited value can also be shown this way: display them as placeholder values in a light gray color. Don\u2019t emphasize comments by making them bold or stand out in any way. Bad example The reflective editor is never shown. The reflective editor provides a default editor for nodes. The editor is only readonly and should only be used for debugging purposes. Bad example You use The right form of projection for the task in the editor. The right projections are used (text, tables, diagrams..) and different kind of projections are provided when necessary (switchable by menu or editor hints). Example: multiple projections You didn\u2019t forget to enable anti aliasing for custom swing components. When you create a custom component and have a paint-Method, call EditorComponent.turnOnAliasingIfPossible to enable anti aliasing. More information can be found in the Java documentation . All usages of symbols are clear. When using symbols, make sure that the user understands what it means. A Plus symbol might be easy to understand (add, increase), a complex shape that is not usuable used might be not. Common icons can be found for example in the fontawesome icon pack . You abbreviate often used words and symbol. Abbreviate words that are often used in the editor or use symbols. Examples: The Letter \u201cm\u201d or a red star * is often used to mark a field as mandatory. The plus sign \u2295 is used to indicate an \u201cadd\u201d action.","title":"UI patterns"},{"location":"patterns/ui_patterns/#ui-patterns-and-anti-patterns","text":"Go through your editors and check the following list.

Make sure to separated this three groups in some ways (such as horizontal lines or empty lines). Mixed example Lines aren\u2019t too thick and not textual. A good maximum width for borders and other lines is 3 pixels. This is just a rough guideline but with thicker lines the design becomes overwhelming. Bad example You don\u2019t emphasize meta/not important information. Good example A smaller font, light gray color or maybe a different font seems to work well. Inherited value can also be shown this way: display them as placeholder values in a light gray color. Don\u2019t emphasize comments by making them bold or stand out in any way. Bad example The reflective editor is never shown. The reflective editor provides a default editor for nodes. The editor is only readonly and should only be used for debugging purposes. Bad example You use The right form of projection for the task in the editor. The right projections are used (text, tables, diagrams..) and different kind of projections are provided when necessary (switchable by menu or editor hints). Example: multiple projections You didn\u2019t forget to enable anti aliasing for custom swing components. When you create a custom component and have a paint-Method, call EditorComponent.turnOnAliasingIfPossible to enable anti aliasing. More information can be found in the Java documentation . All usages of symbols are clear. When using symbols, make sure that the user understands what it means. A Plus symbol might be easy to understand (add, increase), a complex shape that is not usuable used might be not. Common icons can be found for example in the fontawesome icon pack . You abbreviate often used words and symbol. Abbreviate words that are often used in the editor or use symbols. Examples: The Letter \u201cm\u201d or a red star * is often used to mark a field as mandatory. The plus sign \u2295 is used to indicate an \u201cadd\u201d action.","title":"UI Patterns and Anti patterns"},{"location":"patterns/user_experience/","text":"User experience and user interfaces \u00b6 Basics \u00b6 7 Graphic Design Principles to Up-Level your Graphics 7 Gestalt Principles of Design 10 Graphic Design Rules You Should Never Break 20 Most Important UI Design Principles for UI Designer What are the basic rules of user interface design?

The MPS team at itemis is a good environment for doing this. However, we have written a lof of stuff over time. And to increase overall efficiency and to be respectful of the time of the team members, it is recommended to read a few things in advance/in parallel.

In the first part, it discusses some general characterizations of DSLs. Part two is on language design; you should become proficient in the design concerns discussed there. Part three is about language implementation with different tools; you can skip the non- MPS parts, if you want to. The MPS -specific explanations are not quite up to date, but the concepts and approaches explained there are still relevant. One recent extension to MPS we use all the time now is grammar cells, a way to more easily build usable editors for textual notation. We strongly suggest reading this paper: GrammarCells . Next, you may want to take a look at the MPS books by Fabien Campagne . They are essentially a beginner\u2019s guide to language development with MPS . Whenever you want to do something specific, then looking at how to do it in those books is a good starting point for deeper discussions with the colleagues (note: the official documentation might be a better starting point because these book might be outdated in some aspects.) The documentation page also contains videos and tutorials on a variety of specific MPS -related topics. Over the years we have built a lot of useful extensions and utilities to MPS .
