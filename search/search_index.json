The markdown version is Python-Markdown . This page contains the reference for the material theme. Install extra MkDocs plugins in build.gradle + mkdocs.yml. If you are using IntelliJ for editing, it is recommended to install the plugin Grazie Professional for spell checking. Editing \u00b6 The first header should be # . Inserted images with Markdown, not HTML: ![description](url){width=\"600px\"} . Set the with to 600px or 300px, depending on how big or small the image is footnotes syntax The target=_blank attribute and an icon for external links gets automatically added to links. The following symbols must be escaped: $ is &#36; because it collides with inline Latex blocks. Trees can be created with the terminal command tree . It supports the -I parameter for excluding folders. Extensions \u00b6 Besides the Material extensions, the project used the following Pymdown extensions: pymdownx.betterem : different emphasis handling pymdownx.inlinehilite : inline code highlighting; example: #!js var test = 0; pymdownx.magiclink : linkafies URLs pymdownx.smartsymbols : inserts commonly used Unicode characters via ASCII representations. pymdownx.superfences : extension to Markdown fences pymdownx.details : collapsible elements pymdownx.highlight pymdownx.snippets : include other Markdown or HTML snippets into the current Markdown file pymdownx.keys : simplifies inserting key inputs; example: Ctrl + Alt + Del pymdownx.caret : superscript text via caret pymdownx.mark : enables marking words pymdownx.tilde : subscript text via tilde pymdownx.emoji : support for custom Emojis. Some example icons are in MPS Icons . pymdownx.tasklist : support for lists with checkboxes mk_in_html : support for markdown in HTML pymdownx.magiclink : additional link related features mdx-spanner :enables rowspan and colspan in markdown tables Macros \u00b6 The plugin mkdocs-macros-plugin is activated. You can add variables to the extra section of mkdocs.yml (example: mps_latest ) and use the available macros: contribution_by(github_username) question_by(github_username) answer_by(github_username) mps_url(identifier) image_popup() iets3() mbeddr() mbeddr_platform() mps_extensions() mps Look through main. py to see how they are implemented. The identifier can start with one of the following special identifiers: @openapi @mps @baselang @mpsutil @itemis @mbeddr @iets3 The special identifiers get translated to the corresponding package names. Only the last part of the identifier has to be the correct name. The identifier can reference classes, interfaces, concept, and interface declarations in baselanguage, mps-extensions, mbeddr, and iets3. The rest of the identifier only helps to find the correct node and doesn\u2019t have to be exact. Example: @mps.ClassConcept will find jetbrains.mps.baseLanguage.structure.ClassConcept . When the wrong node is selected, enter more parts of the full qualified name of the node. Diagrams \u00b6 Kroki enables support for diagrams ( examples ). It supports the following diagrams: BlockDiag BlockDiag (simple block diagrams) SeqDiag (simple sequence diagrams) ActDiag (simple activity diagrams) NwDiag (simple network diagrams) PacketDiag (packet header diagrams) RackDiag (rack diagrams) BPMN Bytefield C4 (with PlantUML) Ditaa Erd Excalidraw GraphViz Mermaid Nomnoml Pikchr PlantUML Structurizr SvgBob UMLet Vega Vega-Lite WaveDrom They can be embedded by creating a code block and the text kroki-[diagramtype] .

Menu definitions have two flavours named and +default+ and can be defined in transformation or substitute menus. Default substitutions will replace the default menu that MPS shows. Shortcut: Ctrl + Space or Cmd + Space Default menu Transformation menus define UI actions that will be shown in various locations. The menu is defined as a list of sections. Each section contains a list of menu parts for a set of locations. At runtime the menu parts and locations are used to generate the content of the completion menu. The contents of the completion menu are called menu items. Parameterized actions allow to calculate a list of elements of a specific type to be shown in the completion menu. They calculate all elements for the substitution menu and have an influence on the node creation. Moreover, they definesthe selection where the cursor should be placed. How do you find out where a substitute menu entry is coming from? Use the Menu Trace Tool window. More information can be found in Menu Trace Tool Window | MPS .

What\u2019s the best format to improve these descriptions? Is this way the correct/best one to change the autocomplete concept description? asked by: @aquapp In general, it\u2019s up to the users and specific context to decide what makes sense to put to the description text. Usually it should provide additional semantic information to those not familiar with the language to help them to pick up the right concept from the code completion menu. The short description in the concept is the original, simple way to provide static description in the code completion menu. You can also add your own substitute action in the substitute menu of the concept (editor aspect) to get full control over the code completion menu and to be able to generate the text dynamically based on the context. answered by: @wsafonov Languages \u00b6 I need a specific graphical notation/feature for the editor.

No. There used to be performance issues with bigger models that were fixed in MPS 2021.1 . How do you use an empty text for empty cells? Specific Languages Blog: Use empty text for empty cells Explain all cell related variables. A cell takes up a specific amount of space in the editor component (width and height). padding-left/right/top/bottom: a floating point number, which specifies the padding of a text cell, i.e. how much space will be between cell\u2019s text and cell\u2019s left and right sides, respectively. inset: representation of the borders of an element. It specifies the space that an element must leave at each of its edges. baseline: the line upon which most letters sit. ascent: the recommended distance above the baseline for singled spaced text. descent: the recommended distance below the baseline for singled spaced text. height: ascent + descent gap: space between cells in a collection. There is a left and right gap. How can you set editor hints? you can set hints via editorContext . getEditorComponent (). getUpdater () explicit hints for nodes initial hints globally; they behave similar to pushed hints. via right-click: push editor hints and select a specific one. via an EditorHintToggleAction (e.g. in action declarations) They are not visible in the push Editor hints menu. If you need the same behavior e.g. in intentions, you can use code from there (via ConceptEditorHintSettingsComponent.HintsState ) Explicit hints for nodes and hints via EditorHintToggleAction . The usage of ConceptEditorHintSettingsComponent.HintsState is not so obvious. How do you set the cursor to the first editable cell? (A) What it looks like after creation (B) Initial situation with cursor at (1) : pressing Enter leads to (C) The problem is, that in (C) the cursor is at (2) , right before a read-only cell and thus editing or moving to the next cell is not possible. I would like the cursor to jump to the first editable cell, which is at position (3) . Structure of the new node in (C) : Editor of the new node in (C) : Usually, you would set the attracts focus property of the cell, where the cursor should be positioned, to attractsFocus or FirstEditableCell . But, since ( C.2 and C.3 ) are error cells, the default behaviour is to set the cursor in front of the first error cell, which is (C.2) . Therefore, change the first part of your editor to a querylist cell (A) , which references the \u201cmember\u201d in the cell properties (B) and set the read-only property on the querylist. contributed by: @aquapp Is it possible to access the selected value of one swing component from inside another swing component?

How can you hide a custom cell in the editor? ( show if property) Custom cells expect only a cell provider in the inspector, but don\u2019t offer the possibility to specify other attributes to set e.g. \u201cshow if\u201d. How can I hide a custom cell under a specific condition?

(A) What it looks like after creation (B) Initial situation with cursor at (1) : pressing Enter leads to (C) The problem is, that in (C) the cursor is at (2) , right before a read-only cell and thus editing or moving to the next cell is not possible.

Specific Languages Blog: How MPS collects generators to engage on a model genplan (in devkit) vs. generator priorities? The genplan is applied instead of the generator priorities. If your generator should be applied in a model using a genplan, your generator has to be part of the genplan. When developing a language, which is used within an aspect, e.g. typesystem, the MPS aspect\u2019s genplan can block the generator. How can you use generated classes which implement an extension-point? Let \\(L_A\\) be a language which offers an extension-point over class \\(E\\) . Then it is quite simple to provide a static implementation for extension-point for \\(E\\) for example in another language. What if we have want map a concept \\(Q\\) of \\(B\\) to that extension-point? We want to be able to generated Code \\(C\\) from a oncept instance of \\(Q\\) which is a subclass of \\(E\\) , such that we can use it for the extension-point over class \\(E\\) . Create the extension point in the plugin aspect of language \\(L_A\\) . In generator main you need to create two root mapping rules for \\(Q\\) (which is ModelMerge in our case). map_ModelMerge maps \\(Q\\) to a class which extends \\(E\\) (here ConceptMergeSpec ). map_ModelMerge_extension will generate an extension for \\(Q\\) . It is a extension RootMapping which can be selected from the intention. The code for the Reference-Macro in the figure above should look like this. Make sure you have jetbrains.mps. lang .extension included as language in the plugin. Now create a solution, not a sandbox. Set Solution Kind in the properties to Other . Afterwards create a model named plugin (not optional). Add an instance of \\(Q\\) to your model plugin and build it. Looking now at your last transient model, there must be 3 artifacts related to \\(Q\\) : 1.the generated class 2.the generated extension 3.an ExtensionDescriptor which provides all found extensions Now you should be able to locate your extension with a code fragment like this: 1 2 3 foreach obj in extensionPoint / ModelMergeExt / . objects { System . out . println ( \"---> extension \" + obj ); } contributed by: @dbinkele Where should you put classes that you need on the user side and in the generator? Move the classes to a solution and add that solution as a runtime solution to the language (in the module properties). Can you access the output model in a property macro? In reference macros in generators, I can use the provided \u201coutputNode\u201d parameter as an entry point into the output model of the current transformation and e.g. use this to find the root node my generated reference will be contained in. Can I do something similar in property macros? For those, there obviously is no \u201coutputNode\u201d. I\u2019d still like to find, for example, the Node in my output model that my generated property belongs to. Is there a way to do that? asked by: @jonaskraemer You can try to use the post-processing function of a $MAP_SRC$ macro. Which generation plan is used: the one of the custom generation facet or from any of the used devkits? Custom generation facet: if there is a GP defined, this plan is used. Devkits: first, MPS looks if any devkit specifies a GP . The first devKit with an associated plan is consulted, if any, and no further lookup is done. If there are no devkits with associated plans, MPS checks the facets of the devkit modules if any is an GP provider. The first found facet serves as a provider. How to generate XY \u00b6 What can be generated? Have a look at the language repository . You might also find other languages on GitHub. In general there doesn\u2019t have to be an existing language. Any text can be generated with TextGen or Plaintextgen from MPS -extensions . It\u2019s also possible to generate code from an action or pre/post-processing script in the generator by using an existing Java library such as Apache Poi. A tutorial for example for excel can be found here . I want to create multi outputs for a language. 1 Use a dummy concept or a generation plan with a fork. This quesion is also answered in the generator cookbook . How can you generate latex files? The mbeddr documentation language can do this. Have a look at the documentation .

Use mbeddr.mpsutil.interpreter from mbeddr platform . Should you use generation plans or generator priorities? Have a look at the motivation for generation plans in the official documentation . Generation plans should be used when the generation order is simple. How do you generate language X from MPS ? Specific Languages blog: How do I generate language XY from MPS ? How can you make sure that a generator B can use the output of a generator A? Define priorities or a fixed genplan for \\(B\\) (and maybe \\(A\\) ) If you can\u2019t run / don\u2019t want to run both generators in the same \u201cphase\u201d, configure them to run one after each other. Solution 1 : Define a \\(MM\\) (structure) (INFO-NODE) in \\(A\\) where you accumulate all required information and pass for all other generators. Configure \\(A\\) to remove INFO-NODE if not required (separate mapping configuration). Solution 2 : Define an annotation and store all req . infos there Configure \\(A\\) to drop annotation if not required (separate mapping configuration), Solution 3 : Use user objects to store required information as part of the real AST nodes. User objects are volatile children/properties which are not persisted but survive several generation phases. Use com.mbeddr.mpsutil.genutil to achieve this. Solution 4 : Define a fixed genplan with checkpoints. Organize the whole generation process manually. How to generate large strings? Given I am writing a generator and it generates a java string for a string property. That property holds a string of more than 64000 characters and the java compiler gives me a constant string too long error. What can I do? This is how it looks like so far: Option 1 : Extract into a separate file Of course it would be better to not fill the java file too much and instead generate the string into a file that gets loaded at this place. Option 2 : Split and join again The restriction only applies to the size of string literals. However, at runtime, it is allowed to have larger strings. So that we can split it into a concatenation that gets assembled at runtime then: Here we use the Guiva classes Joiner and Splitter from MPS.Core/google.common.base and java.util.Arrays . We use the splitter at generation time to split it into parts of maximal 50000 characters. Then we map it onto an arbitrary node that has a string property, as $LOOP$ requires a node In the property macro inside the loop, we simply pull that property out of the node again (the inspector of this is not visible in the screenshot) It is just a coincidence that we create nodes of the same concept and use the same property for the loop content, than for the outside context node. You may light-quote anything of type string here. contributed by: @abstraktor Open API \u00b6 How can you preview the generated text programmatically? Use the MPS action TextPreviewModel or call the methods in TextGeneratorEngine if you want to use the text generator. How do you get the output path for a solution? To get an IFile , call SModelOperations . getOutputLocation ( model ) . To get an string, call ProjectPathUtil . getGeneratorOutputPath ( module . getModuleDescriptor ()) . You have to first cast the module to an AbstractModule. How can I check if a model requires generation programmatically? The project view shows generation required if a model has been changed. What is the source of this information, and how reliable is it? (regarding the 2 nd part of the question: sometimes the text in the project view is not up to date, but pressing F5 fixes it. Is it just the UI that is not updated when the underlying state changes, or is the state itself not updated properly until F5 is pressed?) ModelGenerationStatusManager provides a corresponding API. This is how to use it: 1 2 3 4 MPSProject project = /* ... */ ; SModel model = /* ... */ ; ModelGenerationStatusManager statusManager = project . getComponent ( ModelGenerationStatusManager . class ); if ( statusManager . generationRequired ( model )) { /* ... */ } Unfortunately, it does\u2019nt seem to be reliable, e.g. when changing something in the model, the API behaves correctly in the first place. But after executing the Synchronize action, MPS for some reason believes that generation is not required any more (even though the change would have an effect on the output and Synchronize doesn\u2019t execute the generation). This odd behavior can also be seen in the project view (note: this might be outdated information). contributed by: @till-f How can you react to changed generated files? 1 2 3 4 5 new GenStatusUpdater ( # project ). getStatusManager (). addGenerationStatusListener ( new ModelGenerationStatusListener () { void generatedFilesChanged ( Collection < SModel > models ) { // do something } ); Troubleshooting \u00b6 MPS can\u2019t resolve the import XY. 3 The solution that contains the class has to be added as a runtime solution (see here ). Why are root nodes generated more than once? Have you used one of your root nodes as a child of another node? It will still act as a root node in this case. No output location for XY. Make sure that the Java facet is enabled in the properties of the language or solution. This error can often be seen when opening an old MPS project. How do I debug generators? Specific Languages Blog: Debugging generators The generated code has no debug symbols. Locate the build solution in MPS that is building your languages and adjust the java settings: java options <project default> generate debug info false generate no warnings false fork false compiler <default compiler> java compliance level 1.8 java compiler options <no additional options> copy resources false Then set generate debug info to true. If no java options exist in your build solution, simply add one in the project structure. How can you debug the differences of generation between command line and MPS ? Given I have an MPS project and it compiles well in my MPS . When I run the same in a command line then I see a compile error. How can I debug this? The issue behind this kind of issues usually lies in one of these three things: Issue Area 1 : Settings (inplace, threading) Try turning off Apply transformations in place in your MPS settings under Build, Execution, Deployment \u2192 Generator \u2192 General , as this is unset in the command line (note, that this setting doesn\u2019t appear in the search): Also, disabling the build in parallel threads may help. Issue Area 2 : Dependencies A second issue may originate from the separate type of class loading and dependency loading in the command line. Issue Area 3 : Generation plans The command line build runs the generator plans that are included in the devkits of a model, or that are explicitly added to the generator facet+tab of a module. If your code starts the build for an explicit generation plan other than that, consider if a different plan could be the culprit. (Remember, right-clicking a model and Show Generation Plan to see if all looks as expected). Remark 1: Inplace transformations are on or off depending on your build script, same applied to parallel generation. On the command line if nothing specified it defaults to 4 threads. The biggest difference is that in the command line build not project is opened, which means anything that tried to access the project including virtual files will fail. Remark 2: One potential source of problems could be packaging of languages and generators. Because in the command line build generators might need to be loaded from packaged jars, any issues with that packaging could affect the generation. For example, as it currently may happen due to MPS -32026 that whole generator models with templates are not loaded and therefore not applied during the generation in the command line. contributed by: @abstraktor MPS forum - I want to export multiple languages from MPS \u21a9 MPS forum - Is it possible to export a DSL compiler created with MPS and use it independently \u21a9 MPS forum - Generator error: uncaught exception ?no classifier? \u21a9","title":"Generator"},{"location":"aspects/generator/#generator-aspect","text":"Generator is a part of language specification that defines the denotational semantics for the concepts in the language. \u2014 MPS documentation","title":"Generator aspect"},{"location":"aspects/generator/#general","text":"Are there any best practices for generators? coolya: Maintainable MPS Generators Can you invoke the generator from an external tool? 2 Yes, it can be run from Ant.

Looking now at your last transient model, there must be 3 artifacts related to \\(Q\\) : 1.the generated class 2.the generated extension 3.an ExtensionDescriptor which provides all found extensions Now you should be able to locate your extension with a code fragment like this: 1 2 3 foreach obj in extensionPoint / ModelMergeExt / . objects { System . out . println ( \"---> extension \" + obj ); } contributed by: @dbinkele Where should you put classes that you need on the user side and in the generator? Move the classes to a solution and add that solution as a runtime solution to the language (in the module properties). Can you access the output model in a property macro? In reference macros in generators, I can use the provided \u201coutputNode\u201d parameter as an entry point into the output model of the current transformation and e.g. use this to find the root node my generated reference will be contained in. Can I do something similar in property macros? For those, there obviously is no \u201coutputNode\u201d. I\u2019d still like to find, for example, the Node in my output model that my generated property belongs to. Is there a way to do that? asked by: @jonaskraemer You can try to use the post-processing function of a $MAP_SRC$ macro. Which generation plan is used: the one of the custom generation facet or from any of the used devkits? Custom generation facet: if there is a GP defined, this plan is used. Devkits: first, MPS looks if any devkit specifies a GP . The first devKit with an associated plan is consulted, if any, and no further lookup is done. If there are no devkits with associated plans, MPS checks the facets of the devkit modules if any is an GP provider. The first found facet serves as a provider.","title":"General"},{"location":"aspects/generator/#how-to-generate-xy","text":"What can be generated? Have a look at the language repository .

Generation plans should be used when the generation order is simple. How do you generate language X from MPS ? Specific Languages blog: How do I generate language XY from MPS ? How can you make sure that a generator B can use the output of a generator A? Define priorities or a fixed genplan for \\(B\\) (and maybe \\(A\\) ) If you can\u2019t run / don\u2019t want to run both generators in the same \u201cphase\u201d, configure them to run one after each other. Solution 1 : Define a \\(MM\\) (structure) (INFO-NODE) in \\(A\\) where you accumulate all required information and pass for all other generators. Configure \\(A\\) to remove INFO-NODE if not required (separate mapping configuration). Solution 2 : Define an annotation and store all req . infos there Configure \\(A\\) to drop annotation if not required (separate mapping configuration), Solution 3 : Use user objects to store required information as part of the real AST nodes. User objects are volatile children/properties which are not persisted but survive several generation phases. Use com.mbeddr.mpsutil.genutil to achieve this. Solution 4 : Define a fixed genplan with checkpoints. Organize the whole generation process manually. How to generate large strings? Given I am writing a generator and it generates a java string for a string property. That property holds a string of more than 64000 characters and the java compiler gives me a constant string too long error. What can I do? This is how it looks like so far: Option 1 : Extract into a separate file Of course it would be better to not fill the java file too much and instead generate the string into a file that gets loaded at this place. Option 2 : Split and join again The restriction only applies to the size of string literals. However, at runtime, it is allowed to have larger strings. So that we can split it into a concatenation that gets assembled at runtime then: Here we use the Guiva classes Joiner and Splitter from MPS.Core/google.common.base and java.util.Arrays . We use the splitter at generation time to split it into parts of maximal 50000 characters. Then we map it onto an arbitrary node that has a string property, as $LOOP$ requires a node In the property macro inside the loop, we simply pull that property out of the node again (the inspector of this is not visible in the screenshot) It is just a coincidence that we create nodes of the same concept and use the same property for the loop content, than for the outside context node. You may light-quote anything of type string here. contributed by: @abstraktor","title":"How to generate XY"},{"location":"aspects/generator/#open-api","text":"How can you preview the generated text programmatically? Use the MPS action TextPreviewModel or call the methods in TextGeneratorEngine if you want to use the text generator. How do you get the output path for a solution?

You have to first cast the module to an AbstractModule. How can I check if a model requires generation programmatically? The project view shows generation required if a model has been changed. What is the source of this information, and how reliable is it? (regarding the 2 nd part of the question: sometimes the text in the project view is not up to date, but pressing F5 fixes it. Is it just the UI that is not updated when the underlying state changes, or is the state itself not updated properly until F5 is pressed?) ModelGenerationStatusManager provides a corresponding API.

But after executing the Synchronize action, MPS for some reason believes that generation is not required any more (even though the change would have an effect on the output and Synchronize doesn\u2019t execute the generation).

Make sure that the Java facet is enabled in the properties of the language or solution. This error can often be seen when opening an old MPS project. How do I debug generators? Specific Languages Blog: Debugging generators The generated code has no debug symbols. Locate the build solution in MPS that is building your languages and adjust the java settings: java options <project default> generate debug info false generate no warnings false fork false compiler <default compiler> java compliance level 1.8 java compiler options <no additional options> copy resources false Then set generate debug info to true. If no java options exist in your build solution, simply add one in the project structure. How can you debug the differences of generation between command line and MPS ? Given I have an MPS project and it compiles well in my MPS . When I run the same in a command line then I see a compile error. How can I debug this? The issue behind this kind of issues usually lies in one of these three things: Issue Area 1 : Settings (inplace, threading) Try turning off Apply transformations in place in your MPS settings under Build, Execution, Deployment \u2192 Generator \u2192 General , as this is unset in the command line (note, that this setting doesn\u2019t appear in the search): Also, disabling the build in parallel threads may help. Issue Area 2 : Dependencies A second issue may originate from the separate type of class loading and dependency loading in the command line. Issue Area 3 : Generation plans The command line build runs the generator plans that are included in the devkits of a model, or that are explicitly added to the generator facet+tab of a module. If your code starts the build for an explicit generation plan other than that, consider if a different plan could be the culprit. (Remember, right-clicking a model and Show Generation Plan to see if all looks as expected). Remark 1: Inplace transformations are on or off depending on your build script, same applied to parallel generation. On the command line if nothing specified it defaults to 4 threads. The biggest difference is that in the command line build not project is opened, which means anything that tried to access the project including virtual files will fail. Remark 2: One potential source of problems could be packaging of languages and generators. Because in the command line build generators might need to be loaded from packaged jars, any issues with that packaging could affect the generation. For example, as it currently may happen due to MPS -32026 that whole generator models with templates are not loaded and therefore not applied during the generation in the command line. contributed by: @abstraktor MPS forum - I want to export multiple languages from MPS \u21a9 MPS forum - Is it possible to export a DSL compiler created with MPS and use it independently \u21a9 MPS forum - Generator error: uncaught exception ?no classifier? \u21a9","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"aspects/intentions/","text":"Intentions aspect \u00b6 Intentions provide fast access to the most used operations with syntactical constructions of a language. \u2014 MPS documentation How can you go to the declaration of an intention when you open the intention menu?

Why does the node ID change during a node test? Given I have a node test case. My test case has a check node called data and my test case has a a test test1 which prints the node ID of data My test case has a a test test2 which prints the node id of data . When I run the test test1 and test2 print different node IDs. Why is that? Terms used: check-node for these fixture nodes that you enter into the test case under nodes test case for the root node, the chunk that contains the tests tests for the test methods of which we have test1 and test2 Each test case runs on its own copy of its model. MPS tries to keep tests reproducible and isolated even when being run in-process. For that, MPS copies the whole model into a temporary model. Modifications of one test case will then be invisible to the next test case, since it will work on a new temporary model. This prevents test-cases from interacting. Running tests in a separate model ensures that they will never modify the original model (as long as you don\u2019t explicitly start acting on other models). Check-nodes per test A test-case may have multiple tests though. MPS also isolates single tests within the same test case. For that, the check-nodes are copied once for each test. Each test may then act on their own copy. 1 2 // there is one data node in the model for each test assert 2 equals data . model . nodes ( Data ). size All tests of a test-case share their referenced nodes To save memory though, these check-nodes all lie in the same model for each test case. References to other nodes outside the test case will only need to be copied once and be shared by all tests of that test case. As a result, the IDs of check-nodes change and the IDs of non-check-nodes are the same as in the original model. 1 2 // nodes in this model that are not check-nodes of this test case will only be there once assert 1 equals dataRef . model . nodes ( Chunk ). size ; Consequently, multiple tests of the same test case are not fully isolated. In the following example, both tests assert and do the same, yet test3 passes while test4 fails. The data element is now located in a separate chunk outside the testcase and the check-node is a reference to it. As a result, test4 is running red because test3 already modified the referenced node. Kinds of tests I checked this behavior in-depth for node tests. I think it is similar for editor tests. I am sure that this does not apply to baseLang-tests since they don\u2019t prepare a temporary model for you. Practical effects of this \u00b6 These are some rules of thumb that result from that: The tests of a test-case may interact, so you should inline all modified nodes into the testcase to be check-nodes . Whenever you modify many nodes in the model, consider writing a migration and migration test instead. Remember that the console and each test will output separate IDs for the conceptually same node. And they will change from run to run. Especially when stepping through tests, it is easy to be confused by that and draw false conclusions Whenever your code queries for the nodes of a model, be ready to see duplicates for each test (as in the dataRef example). You may test this by asserting that something is included or excluded instead of asserting true equality of the expected and actual lists. Another source for duplicates is if the test model imports itself. If you need full power on the temporary model, consider writing a baseLanguage test and creating your repository and model by hand. jetbrains.mps.smodel.TestModelFactory allows to do that, e.g. the ModelListenerTest uses that TestModelFactory.

I would like to write a generator smoke test. Therefor, I have some solutions with models (regular one, not @test models) which are build from command line and the generators invoked are generating some .c files. In addition, I also have a @test model in the same solution with some unit tests which checks if the output directories of these models contain any generated files. I don\u2019t invoke the generation of the models programatically but rely on the ant task which is generating the solution. Unfortunately this setup always leads to broken tests. It seems like the unit tests are executed before the models (which are build during CI run) and though the test fails. asked by: @arimer When the tests work fine when run from within the IDE , then the problem is most probably that when your tests are executed, they are running from the jars and not the sources. The generator output location points into the jar file that the tests are executed from and not to the real source location. You could change the packaging to include the source_gen folder for you specific test solution. This can be done the following way in the default layout of your build model: In this case you would need to detect if you are running from sources or from jar in CI and the change the location where you look for the generated files. This can be done by calculation a solution relative path for the test solution containing the packed sources. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 //case running from .jar if ( module instanceof AbstractModule && (( AbstractModule ) module ). getModuleSourceDir () != null ) { AbstractModule s = (( AbstractModule ) module ); if ( s . isPackaged () && s . getModuleSourceDir (). getBundleHome () != null ) { IFile bundleHome = s . getModuleSourceDir (). getBundleHome (); return bundleHome . getFileSystem (). getFile ( bundleHome . getPath () + \"!\" + path ); } // case: running from sources IFile relativePath = s . getModuleSourceDir (). getDescendant ( path ); return relativePath ; } The easier solution is to place the tests in separate solution and then invoke the make process for the solution that contains your input programmatically, so you can assert over the output.

This can be done the following way in the default layout of your build model: In this case you would need to detect if you are running from sources or from jar in CI and the change the location where you look for the generated files. This can be done by calculation a solution relative path for the test solution containing the packed sources. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 //case running from .jar if ( module instanceof AbstractModule && (( AbstractModule ) module ). getModuleSourceDir () != null ) { AbstractModule s = (( AbstractModule ) module ); if ( s . isPackaged () && s . getModuleSourceDir (). getBundleHome () != null ) { IFile bundleHome = s . getModuleSourceDir (). getBundleHome (); return bundleHome . getFileSystem (). getFile ( bundleHome . getPath () + \"!\" + path ); } // case: running from sources IFile relativePath = s . getModuleSourceDir (). getDescendant ( path ); return relativePath ; } The easier solution is to place the tests in separate solution and then invoke the make process for the solution that contains your input programmatically, so you can assert over the output. An example implementation how the make process is invoked can be found in the mbeddr-c part . answered by: @coolya How to write editor tests for context assistants?

Possible solutions: Specific Languages Blog: mpsclean When using a build script, have a dedicated clean task ( gradle example ). The files from operation from the MPS build model, changes the access permissions of the copied over files. As a workaround you can use Buildlayout_Filemode or unzip the files using Gradle. MPS build script \u00b6 The build-language is one of the oldest parts of MPS , designed to generate the ant files in an easier way, but it isn\u2019t refactored until today. The generator of the build language has to find out what, for example, \u201csolution needs baselanguage\u201d means at runtime-level. To execute code from the solution, the JVM needs the baselanguage.jar on the classpath. The more dependencies the solution has, the more complex becomes the generated ant file, because the generator has to consider all these transitive dependencies. The generator needs to know what artefact a module generates and how the generated artefact/module is used at runtime. Therefore, the jars must be on the classpath. The modules in the mps-groups in the MPS build script contain information from the serialized descriptors (.msd files, .mpl files, \u2026). The Reload all modules from disk intention loads them explicitly. The descriptor files aren\u2019t read before generation, so that you should always verify before you push if your MPS build scripts are up-to-date. For every dependency added to a module or a changed reexport flag, this intention has to be triggered by hand. Problem: the current implementation of the build-language isn\u2019t extensible, because it always looks into the original model. The main part of the ant file generation is the dependency analysis (for the modules), and for this it needs to access the original model for some technical reasons. These limit you to languages which are provided by MPS . You can\u2019t use your own patterns, for example, you can\u2019t write an extension which picks all modules from a folder, generates an intellij-plugin out of them and stores the result in a zip file and generates all the code required for the command-line build. But this isn\u2019t possible because of the build-language-inherent dependency analysis mechanism. The code generator of the build language has to verify for dependencies like jars in stub-models, jars at runtime etc., but the error messages aren\u2019t well-designed. For example, you have a jar file xyz.jar entered as java runtime dependency of the language abc. Instead of something like \u201cyou have to enter xyz.jar to your build layout plugin-123, cause language abc specifies it as java runtime dependency\u201d you get for example \u201cjar stub library should be extracted into build-script: ${my.project}/very/long/path/lib/xyz.jar \u201d, which isn\u2019t helpful. Many problems the generator finds could also be found by the model checker, but the checks are done at generation time and implemented as \u201cgencontext.show error\u201d in the generator. Generated ant scripts ( build.xml ) \u00b6 The mps build scripts are generated to ant scripts, which then generate the modules. The ant script starts a headless- MPS with all required dependencies, puts jars on the classpath and does some further magic. Tasks can be passed to the ant script like the \u201cgenerate\u201d task. Modules have several models with dependencies. For example, for a language, the behavior uses the structure aspect; the type-system uses the behavior aspect etc. which can result in complex dependencies between these models. These have to be considered when the models are generated and compiled. The order is derived by the code generator of the build language and results in an execution plan where the \u201ccompile units\u201d are grouped in \u201cchunks\u201d. Chunks with bootstrap-dependencies are explicitly marked, which means all modules in the chunk have to be compiled at the same time. MPS consists of hundreds of jar files which must be on the classpath for the code generation and compilation, which leads to giant ant scripts (with some thousand lines). Even simple mps build scripts, which only use BaseLanguage result into big ant scripts. The build layout in the MPS build script defines how your modules are packaged e.g. as zip containing multiple plugins, as simple plugin-folder, as lib -folder with a flat list of jars, etc. The ant script needs to know where the local MPS is installed and where your modules and dependencies are located. This is usually done using folder macros in the mps build script which are generated as \u201cproperties\u2019\u2018 in the ant script. This makes the build independent of your local machine and the ant script can be executed on the CI or any other machine.

The generator of the build language has to find out what, for example, \u201csolution needs baselanguage\u201d means at runtime-level. To execute code from the solution, the JVM needs the baselanguage.jar on the classpath. The more dependencies the solution has, the more complex becomes the generated ant file, because the generator has to consider all these transitive dependencies. The generator needs to know what artefact a module generates and how the generated artefact/module is used at runtime. Therefore, the jars must be on the classpath. The modules in the mps-groups in the MPS build script contain information from the serialized descriptors (.msd files, .mpl files, \u2026). The Reload all modules from disk intention loads them explicitly. The descriptor files aren\u2019t read before generation, so that you should always verify before you push if your MPS build scripts are up-to-date. For every dependency added to a module or a changed reexport flag, this intention has to be triggered by hand. Problem: the current implementation of the build-language isn\u2019t extensible, because it always looks into the original model. The main part of the ant file generation is the dependency analysis (for the modules), and for this it needs to access the original model for some technical reasons. These limit you to languages which are provided by MPS . You can\u2019t use your own patterns, for example, you can\u2019t write an extension which picks all modules from a folder, generates an intellij-plugin out of them and stores the result in a zip file and generates all the code required for the command-line build. But this isn\u2019t possible because of the build-language-inherent dependency analysis mechanism. The code generator of the build language has to verify for dependencies like jars in stub-models, jars at runtime etc., but the error messages aren\u2019t well-designed. For example, you have a jar file xyz.jar entered as java runtime dependency of the language abc. Instead of something like \u201cyou have to enter xyz.jar to your build layout plugin-123, cause language abc specifies it as java runtime dependency\u201d you get for example \u201cjar stub library should be extracted into build-script: ${my.project}/very/long/path/lib/xyz.jar \u201d, which isn\u2019t helpful. Many problems the generator finds could also be found by the model checker, but the checks are done at generation time and implemented as \u201cgencontext.show error\u201d in the generator.","title":"MPS build script"},{"location":"build/#generated-ant-scripts-buildxml","text":"The mps build scripts are generated to ant scripts, which then generate the modules. The ant script starts a headless- MPS with all required dependencies, puts jars on the classpath and does some further magic. Tasks can be passed to the ant script like the \u201cgenerate\u201d task. Modules have several models with dependencies. For example, for a language, the behavior uses the structure aspect; the type-system uses the behavior aspect etc. which can result in complex dependencies between these models. These have to be considered when the models are generated and compiled. The order is derived by the code generator of the build language and results in an execution plan where the \u201ccompile units\u201d are grouped in \u201cchunks\u201d. Chunks with bootstrap-dependencies are explicitly marked, which means all modules in the chunk have to be compiled at the same time. MPS consists of hundreds of jar files which must be on the classpath for the code generation and compilation, which leads to giant ant scripts (with some thousand lines). Even simple mps build scripts, which only use BaseLanguage result into big ant scripts. The build layout in the MPS build script defines how your modules are packaged e.g. as zip containing multiple plugins, as simple plugin-folder, as lib -folder with a flat list of jars, etc. The ant script needs to know where the local MPS is installed and where your modules and dependencies are located. This is usually done using folder macros in the mps build script which are generated as \u201cproperties\u2019\u2018 in the ant script. This makes the build independent of your local machine and the ant script can be executed on the CI or any other machine.

If not, ensure the GITHUB_TOKEN permissions are correct: Permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN Depending on the organizational settings, it might be impossible to obtain the artifact via the generic GITHUB_TOKEN . In this case you need to create a new personal access token (PAT). Next, add this token as a secret to the project (e.g. as PRIVATE_REPO_ACCESS_ACTOR and PRIVATE_REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN ): Granting additional permissions Make sure that this secret is not in an environment but generally available. Also add the username. Even though no username is required for token access, an error will occur if you leave it empty. Make sure you authorize the PAT for the SSO org (warning: this resets when changing permissions!)

They need to be prefixed with org.gradle.project.NAME gradle.properties are by default project properties if they are prefixed with systemProp. they are system properties configurations are also separated in the same way as dependencies Gradle Wrapper ( gradlew/gradlew.bat ) \u00b6 The gradle wrapper script downloads gradle in the specified version, independent of your local installed gradle, and then starts the downloaded gradle. It consists of a small java program (located under ./gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar ), an init-file which contains the gradle version ( ./gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties ) and start scripts for Windows, Mac and Linux ( ./gradlew and ./gradlew.bat ). Why do we use gradle? Gradle build scripts have the advantage that you write code instead of XML, like it\u2019s the case using Maven or Ant. We use gradle to download MPS and the dependencies in the correct version and put them in the right place, generate the Ant scripts from the mps build scripts using a build-allScripts.xml Ant scripts and then start Ant with correct parameters (where is MPS on disc, where are the dependencies on disc, \u2026). This is easier than doing it with and directly. For defining the gradle scripts you can use groove ( build.gradle ) or kotlin ( build.gradle.kts ), both can do the same. Groovy is enough for smaller building scripts, but it\u2019s dynamically typed and thus fails late when the gradle task is executed. Kotlin provides type-checking and the auto-completion works better compared to groovy (with Intellij); this makes it easier to use with complex scripts. Dependencies \u00b6 Dependencies inside the buildScript{\u2026} block \u00b6 are placed on the classpath of the build script itself (for the current gradle file which will also be compiled (like java)) To be able to compile the build script into bytecode, its dependencies need to be resolved Dependencies outside the buildScript{\u2026} block \u00b6 are project dependencies these dependencies are added to the project code\u2019s classpath example: Gson is used inside a gradle project and needs to be on the classpath of the project to be able to compile the project. If the dependency in only used in the buildscript (i.e. only from the build.gradle file) then it should be in a buildscript { } block. Dependencies used in both project code and build scripts will effectively need to be listed twice.

How can you fetch dependencies using Gradle? Specific Languages blog: Fetching dependencies with Gradle How to get dependencies from private GitHub repositories within a GitHub action? Follow the default way for GitHub packages access, as described in GitHub Actions . It might simply work if the other private repository is part of the same organization. If not, ensure the GITHUB_TOKEN permissions are correct: Permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN Depending on the organizational settings, it might be impossible to obtain the artifact via the generic GITHUB_TOKEN . In this case you need to create a new personal access token (PAT). Next, add this token as a secret to the project (e.g. as PRIVATE_REPO_ACCESS_ACTOR and PRIVATE_REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN ): Granting additional permissions Make sure that this secret is not in an environment but generally available. Also add the username. Even though no username is required for token access, an error will occur if you leave it empty. Make sure you authorize the PAT for the SSO org (warning: this resets when changing permissions!)

Fall-through: commented : write a comment why a fall-through is necessary in a switch statement. Default case is present : always write a default case for switch statements. Rules common to all identifiers : identifiers use only ASCII letters and digits, and, in a few cases noted below, underscores. Don\u2019t use prefixes or suffixes with particular meanings. For example, these names don\u2019t adhere to the style: name_ , mName , s_name and kName . Package names : package names are all lowercase, with consecutive words concatenated together (no underscores). For example, com.example.deepspace , not com.example.deepSpace or com.example.deep_space . Class names : should be in UpperCamelCase. Class names are typically nouns or noun phrases. For example, Character or ImmutableList . Interface names may also be nouns or noun phrases (for example, List ), but may sometimes be adjectives or adjective phrases instead (for example, Readable ). Test classes should start with the name of the class they\u2019re testing, and ending with Test. For example, HashTest or HashIntegrationTest . Method names : should be in lowerCamelCase. Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases. For example: sendMessage or stop . Underscores may appear in JUnit test method names to separate logical components of the name, with each component written in lowerCamelCase. One typical pattern is _ , for example pop_emptyStack . No correct way exists for naming test methods. Constant names : use all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore Non-constant field names : non-constant field names (static or otherwise) should be lowerCamelCase . These names are typically nouns or noun phrases. For example, computedValues or index . Parameter names should be lowerCamelCase . One-character parameter names in public methods should be avoided. Local variable names should be in lowerCamelCase. Even when final and immutable, local variables are not considered to be constants, and should not be styled as constants. Type variable names : each type variable should adhere to one of two styles: a single capital letter, optionally followed by a single numeral (such as E , T , X , T2 ) or a name in the form used for classes, followed by the capital letter T (examples: RequestT , FooBarT ).

If you are new to MPS and want to learn more about MPS , start with the following links: Learn MPS | official JetBrains landing page Get started with MPS | mps.rocks Learning MPS | mps.rocks Is there a high level presentation that I can have a look at? Yes, there is a presentation from 2020 by V\u00e1clav Pech . What are the most important shortcuts? F1RE blog: JetBrains MPS Shortcuts What can you do if a problem occurs that isn\u2019t in this list? Try invalidating the cache and restarting MPS (same menu). Search the forum and issue tracker . Ask a question on Slack . I changed something in a settings page and nothing changed. There might be a bug related to caching. Reopening the dialog, invalidating the cache or restarting the project might help. Which standard IDE settings should you change? The maximum heap size setting should be changed to a higher values such as 8 GB when using many languages or plugins. Another reason for high memory usage can be many (poorly) implemented checking rules. I am running low on memory or the IDE is running slow. What can you do without restarting MPS ? When you have enabled the loaded models indicator in the lower right corner of the screen, you can click on the text to unload not needed models . The memory indicator at the same location can be used to free memory. As a last resort the power saving mode can be enabled which disables background tasks such as the model checker (not recommended). What\u2019s the difference between a module and a model? Specific Languages blog: Ambiguous terms: Modules and models What\u2019s a SRepository and how\u2019s it structured? The answer can be found in the MPS source code .Multiple repositories could be available in the feature. Given a repository, references to modules/models/nodes can be resolved. There\u2019s no need in making ids unique globally as each subsystem knows, which exact repository it needs to use at any moment. (e.g. the type-system knows where it stores its type-nodes, so it will not try to resolve references to them ) A repository contains modules, modules have model roots, each model root can load models. Also a module can be a models container itself (without model root). A model is then a set of root nodes. Each root node is a root of a tree of nodes, So that overall, a repository is a tree structure. Is there an existing expression/scripting language? There is the expressions sample project.

Specific Languages blog: Why is my project suddenly read-only? How do you work with more than one project in MPS ? Given I want to work on a MPS project that uses other projects and I want to switch between tasks that sometimes need changes on both, in the dependent project and the root project. I would like to switch back and forth between using the default prepackaged project dependencies and my own repository of them where I build them myself. How could I do that? Option 0 : Open multiple projects in MPS at the same time Works when doing small changes fast unreliable: when changing dependencies in my source models, this leads to a reload operation on the repository, which sometimes messes up the loaded repository and caches Option 1 : Publish and pull from local maven ( IETS3 ) reliable example gradle script needs to be told to pull from local repository \u2013 e.g. by providing -PforceLocalDependencies to IETS3 \u2013 or use dependency overrides Option 3 : Changing project libraries does not affect command line builds Option 3a : Command line setup Task ( IETS3 ) We usually have a ./gradlew setup task in our projects that replaces your .mps/libraries.xml . When you want to change the project, you\u2019ll need to change the configuration of that command line setup task and rerun it. Option 3b : MPS Path variables in settings (deprecated) In the MPS setttings, you can configure path variables that can be used in .mps/libraries.xml to pinpoint to the location of a target project. They will only configure the MPS behavior and not affect the command line builds. So in most cases, you don\u2019t want to use them and instead let your build script setup these files. contributed by: @abstraktor Why is MPS shipped with JBR instead of using an installed JDK / JRE ? JBR is a fork of OpenJDK with specific bugfixes and improvements for JetBrains IDEs. More info can be found in JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime .

The example comes from this article : Most OOP programming languages support single dispatch, more commonly known as virtual methods. For example, consider the following code: Single dispatch 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 public class SpaceShip { public string GetShipType () { return \"SpaceShip\" ; } } public class ApolloSpacecraft extends SpaceShip { public string GetShipType () { return \"ApolloSpacecraft\" ; } } SpaceShip ship = new ApolloSpacecraft (); System . out . println ( ship . GetShipType ()); // output: (1) ApolloSpacecraft The actual method implementation which should be called, is chosen at runtime based solely on the actual type of ship. So, only the type of single object is used to select the method, hence the name single dispatch. Note: Single dispatch is one form of dynamic dispatch , for example, the method is chosen at runtime. If the method is chosen at compile time (true for all non-virtual methods), it\u2019s called static dispatch . Now add some asteroids: Double dispatch 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 public class Asteroid { public void collideWith ( SpaceShip s ) { System . out . println ( \"Asteroid hit a SpaceShip\" ); } public void collideWith ( ApolloSpacecraft a ) { System . out . println ( \"Asteroid hit an ApolloSpacecraft\" ); } } public class ExplodingAsteroid extends Asteroid { public void collideWith ( SpaceShip s ) { System . out . println ( \"ExplodingAsteroid hit a SpaceShip\" ); } public void collideWith ( ApolloSpacecraft a ) { System . out . println ( \"ExplodingAsteroid hit an ApolloSpacecraft\" ); } } public class DoubleDispatch { public static void main ( string [] args ) { Asteroid theAsteroid = new Asteroid (); SpaceShip theSpaceShip = new SpaceShip (); ApolloSpacecraft theApolloSpacecraft = new ApolloSpacecraft (); theAsteroid . collideWith ( theSpaceShip ); // output: (1) theAsteroid . collideWith ( theApolloSpacecraft ); // output: (2) System . out . println (); ExplodingAsteroid theExplodingAsteroid = new ExplodingAsteroid (); theExplodingAsteroid . collideWith ( theSpaceShip ); // output: (3) theExplodingAsteroid . collideWith ( theApolloSpacecraft ); // output: (4) System . out . println (); Asteroid theAsteroidReference = theExplodingAsteroid ; theAsteroidReference . collideWith ( theSpaceShip ); // output: (5) theAsteroidReference . collideWith ( theApolloSpacecraft ); // output: (6) System . out . println (); // Note the different datatypes SpaceShip theSpaceShipReference = theApolloSpacecraft ; theAsteroid . collideWith ( theSpaceShipReference ); // output: (7) theAsteroidReference . collideWith ( theSpaceShipReference ); // output: (8) } } Asteroid hit a SpaceShip Asteroid hit an ApolloSpacecraft Exploding Asteroid hit a SpaceShip Exploding Asteroid hit anApolloSpacecraft Exploding Asteroid hit a SpaceShip Exploding Asteroid hit an ApolloSpacecraft Asteroid hit an ApolloSpacecraft ExplodingAsteroid hit a SpaceShip The desired result here would be ExplodingAsteroid hit an ApolloSpacecraft but instead you get ExplodingAsteroid hit a SpaceShip .

The condition of the conditional editor is not optional, it has to be set. Tables \u00b6 de.slisson.mps.tables Use slisson-tables instead of mps-tables because the language is more flexible (and not deprecated). The language displays content in a tabular format. The table can be hard-coded or can consist of complex queries/dynamic content. You have to add new cells and rows in the editor. They can also be readonly. You need a little experience (trial-and-error) to create these tables.

In the MPS layout algorithms the children decide about their width and height and the parent cell can only arrange the already layouted children. In the algorithms from the celllayout language are similar to the swing layouters where the child is asked for its min / max /preferred size, but the parent decides about the size of the child and the child then has to fit itself into these bounds. This is used in tables and diagram, but also for the styles defined in the de.itemis.mps.celllayout language ( source ). What does grow-x and push-x do? Grow-x grows the cell to the with of the parent. Push-x is like setting grow-x on the cell and all ancestor cells.

The guide was written some years ago, so it might not reflect the workflow and guidelines of newer committers anymore. Commit messages \u00b6 In general, try to follow this guide with some exceptions for minor changes: When you commit a major change that relates to a GitHub issue, start your commit message with a short title (less than 50 char). Ideally, it contains the title of the GitHub issue if it fits. If you can\u2019t fit the issue title, please reference the issue ID with #4711 notation in the title. The title is followed by a short optional paragraph (not longer than 80 chars) describing the change: 1 2 3 ClassCastException on FilteringActionManager #1207 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. In contrast, if your commit is just a minor fix, then you mention the modified mbeddr subsystem (for example mpsutil: , core: or ext : ) and provide a short description, followed by a short optional paragraph (not longer than 80 chars) describing the change: 1 2 3 core,ext: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. The optional paragraph at the end of your commit message contains further information about the change. Tests were added or describe why the fix was necessary, maybe there are special conditions when the issue surfaces. This is also the place where you can put GitHub issue commands to close or reference other issues. Further information and ideas on how to write good commit messages can be found here and here Branches \u00b6 We make heavy use of branches in the development process. If your task requires more than one commit, commit your changes on a branch. Two types of branches exist: feature and refactor : the first is used for new features, the second for bug fixes or code refactorings. They are distinguished by prefix: a feature branch my-awesome-stuff would be named feature/my-awesome-stuff or refactor/my-awesome-stuff , if it\u2019s a refactoring branch. Both kinds of branches should be short living (a couple of days) to reduce the risk of diverting to far from master and causing huge afford to merge. Ideally, no commits happen directly to master and every commit is first evaluated on a feature/refactoring branch. Note: Nowadays we mostly do merging instead of rebasing. The following sections might therefore not accurately reflect the current workflow. Merging \u00b6 Once your work is done, it needs to be integrated into the master branch. Because your branch most likely diverted from master, merging it into master would normally end up with a merge commit on the master branch. We have learned the hard way that merging clutters Git history and makes all intermediate commits of the branch end up in master. To prevent this, the suggested workflow is to rebase your branch onto master and thereby squash all your commits into a single one. Example \u00b6 This example shows you how to integrate your branch into the master branch by using rebase instead of merge. The list of commands to use is: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 git fetch git rebase -i origin/master git checkout origin/master git pull git merge --ff-only feature/my-awesome-stuff git pull --rebase git push They are all explained below. Below you can see the starting point in the repository: 1 2 * 1ed51e3 (HEAD -> master) added another file * 5cee848 initial commit Now create the new feature branch named feature/my-awesome-stuff and commit some changes on it. While working on your branch, someone else committed changes into the master branch. Hence, for integrating your changes into master you would end up with a merge: 1 2 3 4 5 6 * 3c36424 (HEAD -> master) fixed some super important issue | * 66beba4 (feature/my-awesome-stuff) more work on my awesome feature | * cca995e did some stuff |/ * 1ed51e3 added another file * 5cee848 initial commit To get your commits into master , first make sure that your local history is up-to-date by running git fetch . Next, rebase your commits. This prevents a merge from happening. This is achieved with the following git command on our branch: git rebase -i origin/master . Git will now ask you how to proceed with your commits: 1 2 pick cca995e did some stuff pick 66beba4 more work on my awesome feature Now squash all commits into a single commit while rebasing: 1 2 pick cca995e did some stuff squash 66beba4 more work on my awesome feature Afterward, Git asks you to enter a message for the new commit. The default message it offers is a concatenation of all the commit messages from the commits to squash. However, you want to make the new commit message fit the earlier described pattern. After rebasing your Git history looks like this: 1 2 3 4 * afc0fb5 (HEAD -> feature/my-awesome-stuff) 42: super awesome feature * 3c36424 (master) fixed some super important issue * 1ed51e3 added another file * 5cee848 initial commit You still have to branch; now it\u2019s time to merge them. Change your git branch to master using git checkout origin/master . Make sure you have pulled from the remote and your branch is up-to-date. Now run git merge --ff-only feature/my-awesome-stuff . The \u2013ff-only is important to force git to not merge if it would produce a merge commit. Now Git history looks like this: 1 2 3 4 * afc0fb5 (HEAD -> master, feature/my-awesome-stuff) 42: super awesome feature * 3c36424 fixed some super important issue * 1ed51e3 added another file * 5cee848 initial commit You haven\u2019t created a merge commit, and all commits from your branch appear as a single commit in the Git history. You are good to go to push back to the repo . But wait, what if somebody has changes things in the meantime on the remote, wouldn\u2019t the pull create a new merge? Yes it would! Therefor don\u2019t use a plain git pull but use git pull --rebase in case you are pulling from the repo into your local master branch. This way, Git doesn\u2019t produce a new merge commit but rebase your local changes on top of the remote changes. Test Organization \u00b6 Naming \u00b6 The test solution for language com.mbeddr.x. lang should be named test.com.mbeddr.x. lang . Respectively, the test solution for solution com.mbeddr.y. sol should be named test.com.mbeddr.y. sol . If you need a dedicated language for testing purposes, you should name it test.com.mbeddr.x.[ lang | sol ].testsupport (or a similar suffix). This way, you can discriminate between \u201creal\u201d code below namespace com.mbeddr and test code below namespace test . You should also place any demo or playground modules outside the com.mbeddr namespace for the same reason. By following this scheme, you can build productive code in the UI by building everything below com.mbeddr in the modules pool, and be assured not to be interfered by test, demo, or playground code. Project Structure \u00b6 All languages, solutions, tests, demos, and playgrounds of one feature should be placed below a common virtual folder bearing the name of the feature. An exception might be build models. Generators must be present only when required or deleted if empty. This allows us to access all artifacts constituting one feature. File System \u00b6 All test code should be placed in a special folder in the file system: Build \u00b6 Build script setup \u00b6 In mbeddr there are different build scripts. They are used on the local machines for building the languages and on the build server for various build-related tasks, such as testing or packaging. This documentation guides you in following the mbeddr standards for setting up your BuildProject and integrating it into Mbeddr\u2019s build infrastructure. Required BuildFolderMacros \u00b6 In your BuildProject (the build script\u2019s model representation in MPS ) you first need a BuildFolderMacro (a folder ) named mps.home (see code snippet below). If you want to run the generated ant script in your MPS , then you should specify the location of your MPS installation in a relative way, otherwise you don\u2019t need a path for mps.home . At script execution time, you will redefine mps.home , to point to the folder where your MPS installation is located at. 1 folder mps.home = <no defaultPath> Next, you need a BuildFolderMacro named artifacts.root that doesn\u2019t require a path (see snippet below). When executing the ant script, generated from your BuildProject , define this macro from outside to point to the folder where all your plugin dependencies (for example: mbeddr.platform ) are located. 1 folder artifacts.root = <no defaultPath> For each BuildProjectDependency (the dependency\u2019s section below your folders) we need a separate BuildFolderMacro that follows the naming convention .artifacts and points to $artifacts.root/<BuildProject name> . At build script execution time, those macros will point to the folders, where your required plugins are located. In the code snippet below you can see the resulting BuildFolderMacros for a BuildProject with two dependencies: mps- sl -all and com.mbeddr.platform. 1 2 folder sl-all.artifacts = $artifacts.root/mps-sl-all folder platform.artifacts = $artifacts.root/com.mbeddr.platform Type system tests \u00b6 When you want to build type system tests that require a specific path macro (for example: for specifying the project location inside your TestInfo ), then you must create a BuildFolderMacro for this path macro. The name of this BuildFolderMacro should start with mps.macro , followed by the name of the respective path macro. In the example below, you instruct MPS via mps.macro.mbeddr.github.core.home to create a path macro mbeddr.github.core.home that points to the relative path location specified in the other BuildFolderMacro mbeddr.github.core.home . 1 folder mps.macro.mbeddr.github.core.home = $mbeddr.github.core.home Furthermore, you need to mark solutions containing type system tests as content: (with sources and tests) . To achieve this, please perform the following steps: Inside your BuildProject move your cursor to the solution that contains your type system tests. Open the inspector. Inside the Inspector select the node sources, open the context menu and select sources and tests from it. To get your tests executed, you first need to add the module-tests plugin to your use plugins: section (on top of your BuildProject ). When you can\u2019t add the node module-tests to this section, import it from jetbrains.mps.build.mps.tests.accessories . Finally, create a BuildMpsLayout_TestModules (a test configuration ) at bottom of your BuildProject and list there all solutions that contain type system tests to be executed. Configurations for generator and compiler \u00b6 To make sure code is generated and compiled the same way as in MPS , you have to add the following configurations ( BuildSource_JavaOptions and BuildMps_GeneratorOptions ) to your BuildProject \u2018s project structure. Those configurations control the generator engine and the Java compiler to make sure we have the same build behavior as in the IDE . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 generator options <project default> strict mode true multiple threads true number of threads 4 inplace transform true hide warnings false resort to static references true java options <project default> generate debug info true generate no warnings false fork false compiler <default compiler> java compliance level 1.6 java compiler options <no additional options> copy resources false Building a release \u00b6 For preparing a mbeddr release, you can modify the version number that is set for the mbeddr plugins by overwriting the values of major.version , minor.version and build (see screenshot below). However, you don\u2019t change these values inside the MPS build scripts, instead, either you change them in the global gradle script ( mbeddr.core/build.gradle ), or you overwrite them via the command line while spawning a new release build: -PmajorVersion=1 -PbuildVersion=0 -PminorVersion=0000 build_mbeddr publishMbeddrAllInOnePublicationToMavenRepository","title":"Development guide"},{"location":"mbeddr/development_guide/#development-guide","text":"This document describes how the mbeddr team uses Git for contributing changes.

Next, rebase your commits. This prevents a merge from happening. This is achieved with the following git command on our branch: git rebase -i origin/master . Git will now ask you how to proceed with your commits: 1 2 pick cca995e did some stuff pick 66beba4 more work on my awesome feature Now squash all commits into a single commit while rebasing: 1 2 pick cca995e did some stuff squash 66beba4 more work on my awesome feature Afterward, Git asks you to enter a message for the new commit. The default message it offers is a concatenation of all the commit messages from the commits to squash. However, you want to make the new commit message fit the earlier described pattern. After rebasing your Git history looks like this: 1 2 3 4 * afc0fb5 (HEAD -> feature/my-awesome-stuff) 42: super awesome feature * 3c36424 (master) fixed some super important issue * 1ed51e3 added another file * 5cee848 initial commit You still have to branch; now it\u2019s time to merge them. Change your git branch to master using git checkout origin/master . Make sure you have pulled from the remote and your branch is up-to-date. Now run git merge --ff-only feature/my-awesome-stuff . The \u2013ff-only is important to force git to not merge if it would produce a merge commit. Now Git history looks like this: 1 2 3 4 * afc0fb5 (HEAD -> master, feature/my-awesome-stuff) 42: super awesome feature * 3c36424 fixed some super important issue * 1ed51e3 added another file * 5cee848 initial commit You haven\u2019t created a merge commit, and all commits from your branch appear as a single commit in the Git history. You are good to go to push back to the repo . But wait, what if somebody has changes things in the meantime on the remote, wouldn\u2019t the pull create a new merge? Yes it would! Therefor don\u2019t use a plain git pull but use git pull --rebase in case you are pulling from the repo into your local master branch. This way, Git doesn\u2019t produce a new merge commit but rebase your local changes on top of the remote changes.","title":"Example"},{"location":"mbeddr/development_guide/#test-organization","text":"","title":"Test Organization"},{"location":"mbeddr/development_guide/#naming","text":"The test solution for language com.mbeddr.x. lang should be named test.com.mbeddr.x. lang .

Try casting it to AbstractModule first. Is there a way to start two instances of MPS , each with its own cache/state?

How can you make an internal MPS editor read-only? Given I want to make a contribution to a generator the j.mps.lang.editor . When I download the MPS source , open the project in MPS under code and open j.m.l.editor/SubstituteMenuPart_ReferenceScope_declare , then I see the model being read-only. What can I do? You need to open MPS in IDEA (Community Edition is enough), compile and run it from there, then you can edit MPS sources. There are instructions in README . How can you do a fulltext search in the IDE ? I sometimes need a textual search which MPS doesn\u2019t provide out of the box. In that situation, I am unsure of the concept and type of what I see, so a top-down search is not an option. Instead I would like to search for that string to have a starting point for my investigation. Examples: I want to investigate in an editor in the user interface and don\u2019t want to reverse engineer what hints, editors and concepts lead to what I see. Behavioral view code, like custom cells, swing cells or querylists make it hard to figure out where the source logic of that is located. when the console shows something I don\u2019t understand, I\u2019d like to see its context source code, so that I can figure out what to do next. Option 0 : Use Language Debugging facilities of MPS instead. For built-in languages, MPS brings a load of dedicated debugging facilities: Debugging editor cells and nodes: When you right-click an item in the editor, you can find a submenu Language Debug . Debugging menu entries: Select an item that you\u2019re curious in and press Cmd + Alt + B / Ctrl + Alt + B to open the Menu Trace of it. Setup and an IntelliJ and connect it to step through java code. Option 1 : Search for literals from console. Option 2 : Search through serialized Java. Set up IntelliJ with your project. Hit Cmd + Shift + F / Ctrl + Shift + F to search in path. When you found a class of interest, open it in MPS via Cmd + N / Ctrl + N . The source node usually has a similar name. This is great for finding editor nodes, for example, if that java class is named Vehicle_EditorBuilder , your source node was an editor for the Vehicle concept. Last Resort : Search XML model directly. Use this only if you have no assembly and your project doesn\u2019t open. The serialized API is subject to change and using this should be the last barrier. Then use ack (or a similar tool) on the command line to find the relevant models that contain this string. The output even contains the node id though, as in this example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 $ ack \"ack com.mbeddr.mpsutil.grammarcells\" \u2026 <node concept=\"3bR9La\" id=\"1aL6sVX49Cb\" role=\"1SiIV1\"> <property role=\"3bR36h\" value=\"false\" /> <ref role=\"3bR37D\" to=\"90a9:F1NWDqq_DA\" resolve=\"com.mbeddr.mpsutil.grammarcells.runtime\" /> </node> \u2026 Use new IdEncoder (). parseNodeId ( \"1aL6sVX49Cb\" ) to get the node id . This will print the corresponding node to console. Clicking it will open in in MPS : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 # nodes . where ({ ~ it => boolean equals = false ; try { equals = it / . getNodeId (). equals ( new IdEncoder (). parseNodeId ( \"1aL6sVX49Cb\" )); } catch ( Exception e ) { < no statements > } return equals ; }) How to get rid of Error: shall specify a repository to lock? When accessing model properties in rendering code, you must encapsulate the model accessing code in a read action: It always has an error \u201cError: shall specify a repository to lock\u201d. How can I get rid of it? What is a \u2018repository\u2019 and is there any documentation that explains the concept and how to use it correctly? asked by: @cwalesch The repository is what is represented as the \u201cmodules pool\u201d in the UI . It contains all the dependencies currently visible. At the moment there is only one global repository which causes several problems. MPS is slowly but steadily moving to project specific repositories. That would mean each project (window) of MPS would have it\u2019s own separate repository. To get the repository you will need access to the project. e.g. the editor context will give you access to the repository: editorContext.getRepository() . In other cases, for instance, when you don\u2019t have an editor context directly available you need to make sure that from UI (action) you pass the project or repository though to the place where you need it. answered by: @coolya How can you get an identifier of a node? Given I have a node myNode and I need to serialize something that identifies it. When I serialize that something and then deserialize that identifier again, then I will find exactly that node. How can I build such a thing? Option 1 : PersistenceFacade ID Since the url does not look nice; you may use this combined string of model ID and node ID that is used for the url. For that, import the class org.jetbrains.mps.openapi.persistence.PersistenceFacade from the MPS .OpenApi stub and run: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 # serialize identifier string mySerializedId = SNodePointer . serialize ( node / . getReference ()) # find node based on serialized identifier node <> myFoundNode = SNodePointer . deserialize ( mySerializedId ). resolve ( repository ) # then , node == myFoundNode Option 2 : Url Import the httpsupport language and use node.getURL . This will be a url that you can use locally to open this node. It includes the node id and the model and thus is a pretty good globally unique id . This id is a local URL and looks odd though: http://127.0.0.1:63320/node?ref=r%3A4bc03cd1-b1e3-49da-84da-f27e7062f6f7%28integrityOfUpdate%29%2F2209769512593382448&project=SecurityAnalyst . Especially the code to find the node again based on this url contains some grepping then. Option 3 : Node Id Use node / . getNodeId (). toString () it will yield the nodes id . Note that a node ID is only unique within this model. If it should be globally unique, consider option 1. contributed by: @abstraktor Where does MPS store preferences?

It should work with MPS 2021.1.4 and higher. Although it was introduced in Intellij IDEA 2020.1 it might not work in older MPS versions because of classloading issues. The browser itself ( JBCefBrowser ) can be embedded in the MPS editor with a swing component cell. For simple use cases, it is enough to call browser.loadHTML to load some HTMl code. The code can be created by Java or by calling the MPS generator or TextGen . Existing Java documentation and examples on the web: Java JCEF example that showcases all kinds of handlers and dialogs IntelliJ Markdown preview How do I use JCEF with Intellij? CEF documentatation (non Java version) The third link contains an answer on how to do bidirectional communication between the embedded browser and Java ( MPS ): You have to create a browser pipe between Java ( implementation ) and JS ( implementation ). The communication is done through JS. You then have a subscribe method that you can use to listening to events posted through a specific tag or create an event using the post method. These methods are available in Java and JS. Warning : MPS and the Intellij IDEA use Swing to create all the UI components. They are considered lightweight because they are drawn by Java itself. JCEF uses native code, it is a heavyweight component. Especially with MPS \u2018 reloading capabilities, it is important to correctly dispose the browser when it isn\u2019t needed anymore. The following code registers a listener for the editor component dispose event and also closes the browser: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 class SwingComponent { void create () { // ...

It describes both the expected state and all bugs deviating from the expectations. Overview \u00b6 The module pool has all content known to MPS . The modules pool is filled from modules in the current project and all non-project sources . MPS in general cares about dependencies between modules. The dependencies on models only constrain further the dependencies of the modules. Two main types of relations exist: dependencies are needed for any reference to something in another module. Used Languages are needed to use something defined in a language. We refer to relations if we address both types. Other types of dependencies on modules include: Java stubs (in combination with Java libraries ), Java source stubs (in combination with Java source paths ), runtime solutions and accessory models (only available for languages), and languages engaged on generation . Build models abstract Ant files to build and package modules and IDEA plugins . They contain a copy of the relations defined in the modules, and dependencies to other build models and IDEA plugins. MPS Plugins \u00b6 MPS Plugins are automatically loaded according to the solution Kind set in Java module settings. MPS Plugins need to be contained in MPS plugin models. StandalonePluginDescriptor \u00b6 We need to add a StandalonePluginDescriptor (defined in Language jetbrains.mps. lang .plugin.standalone ) as a root node if a MPS plugin model uses any concept from the language jetbrains.mps. lang .plugin . Other concepts from the language jetbrains.mps. lang .plugin.standalone don\u2019t need a StandalonePluginDescriptor . Plugin disambiguation \u00b6 The term \u201cplugin\u201d is used at various places throughout MPS . It describes different things: IDEA plugins: a packaged set of contributions to the IntelliJ IDEA platform, which MPS is based upon. MPS plugins: automatically loaded Models. Plugin language aspect: model inside a aanguage defining extension points. Build model plugins: part of the build model language providing new entries for build models. Non-project sources \u00b6 Non-project sources are global libraries IDEA plugins project libraries common and Java module settings regarding Java classes and Java source files IDEA plugins referenced by a module These directories or jar files are recursively scanned for .mpl (languages), .msd (solutions), and .devkit (devkit) files. If found, the corresponding content is added to the modules pool. Java classpath versus relations \u00b6 The various settings on models and modules specify both the Java classpath and the relations of a model. However, these settings affect classpath and relations in a different way. As a rule of thumb, the classpath has all Java classes reachable through any kind of relation. The Classpath is populated generously. On the contrary, the relations are populated reluctantly, for example, they need to be specified explicitly. The dependency relations on modules and models are completely separated from the used language relations on modules and models. Thus, no dependency requires a Used Language or vice versa. Used languages \u00b6 No implicitly Used Languages are available except described for generators. Specifically, if LanguageB has an Extends Scope dependency on LanguageA and ModuleC uses LanguageB , LanguageA isn\u2019t a Used Language within ModuleC . You must add LanguageA (containing ConceptA ) to ModuleB\u2019s and contained ModelB\u2019s used languages if and only if ModelB instantiates ConceptA within the IDE . ModelB executes intentions from LanguageA . ModelB requires type checks from LanguageA . ModelB uses editors from LanguageA by selecting an editor hint but not if LanguageA only defines the editor hint. ModuleB is a generator and outputs instance of ConceptA . Executed generators \u00b6 GeneratorA contained in LanguageA (containing ConceptA ) will be executed for ModelS (contained in ModuleS ) if and only if ModelS uses LanguageA and contains an instance of ConceptA ModelS lists LanguageA in Languages engaged on generation The preceding conditions match LanguageB containing GeneratorB extending GeneratorA For discussion, we establish a continued scenario: (The Relations listed here are not complete in order to reduce clutter. The complete example is available.) SolutionBase doesn\u2019t change during generation, as LanguageBase doesn\u2019t define any generators. SolutionBaseGen doesn\u2019t change during generation either, as it doesn\u2019t contain any instances from LanguageBaseGen , thus removing LanguageBaseGen from the list of applicable generators, ending up with no generators at all. SolutionBaseGen2 ends up with a transformed NodeBase , as Languages engaged in generation are never removed. SolutionBaseGenExtends ends up with an unchanged NodeBase , but a transformed NodeBase2 . GeneratorBaseExtends gets executed, because LanguageBaseGenExtends is listed in Languages engaged in generation . However, the Dependencies of the Language aren\u2019t considered for selecting the running Generators. In SolutionBaseGenExtends2 both NodeBase and NodeBase2 will be transformed, as LanguageBaseGenExtends2 is listed in Languages engaged in generation and GeneratorBaseExtends2 extends GeneratorBase . Only NodeExtendsGen will be transformed in SolutionExtendsGen , as the only active Generator is GeneratorExtendsGen . The reason is that we found an instance of ConceptExtendsGen contained in the same language as the generator. The Generator doesn\u2019t extend any other applicable Generator. All nodes within SolutionExtendsGen2 get transformed, as an instance of ConceptExtendsGen2 was found, and the generator GeneratorExtendsGen2 contained in the same language extends GeneratorBase . Generated relations \u00b6 Relations on the output model are defined only by the contents of the output model that was created by the generator. Thus, all languages providing the concepts of generated instances are listed in Used Languages all models referenced from the output model are listed in the dependencies Extra relations on anything else (source module, source model, dependencies of the source model, languages used in the source model, dependencies of applied generators, languages used in applied Generators) are not added to the output model.

Build language test instruction to search the model for tests. As soon as you are using any concepts from language jetbrains.mps. lang .test , you need to have a TestInfo root node in the same model.

Here are some colors with a high contrast: When using a gray scale color, make sure that the text color doesn\u2019t exceed 48% brightness ( source ). Make also sure to provide different colors for different color schemes (e.g. darcula theme vs light theme). Bad example #1 Bad example #2 Bold and underline aren\u2019t used together. This is an anti-pattern. More information can be found in this article . MPS related summary: Bold important phrases highlighting keywords Italic/Emphasis Used to highlight quotes (some use blockquotes). Foreign words. Underline Used for links CAPS Used for acronyms You use buttons correctly. (Swing) Buttons use appropriate symbols/text to make clear what they do. Buttons can alse be used as up and down keys. Buttons can also be hidden to not disrupt the text editing: Add option to hide buttons (checkbox, editor hint, action, etc.). Clickable elements appear clickable. When elements are clickable, they should appear clickable: They should use an indicator or different style (e.g. underlines and blue or styled like a button). You align collections when possible. Alignment is an important aspect in design ( introduction ). Use vertical grids instead of vertical collections to align cells nicely. It is also very important for readability. You use color for emphasis and to convey information. Not only bold font can be used to emphasize words but also color. Make sure that the used color is correctly associated by the user. Bad example Greyscale editor + grey is associated with disabled content/meta information such as comments. Good example Color is used to distinguish different language features: BLUE for numbers, lila/green for CONSTANTS. You use labels in a consistent way. Labels should be used consistently in the design (e.g. always bold, colon after label), the same goes for key value pairs. There is no best practise for the separation between label and text. Some ideas and common guidelines can be found here . The context of UI elements is consistent. Counterexample: There are 3 buttons next to each other that look similar: One opens an external documentation, the other navigates to a root node and the third one undos a change. This could be confusing and frustrating for the user. A default empty statement exists. There should always be a default concept that acts as an empty line or empty text. It should be editable and support autocompletion. They should have an indicator that they are editable. The easist way is to provide a placeholder value. Bad example Different groups are distinguishable from each other. Groups can be separated for example by whitespace, by drawing a border (box) or drawing brackets around the content. You emphasize non-standard operations/literals. Emphasize special operations or literals to make it clear that they are not. Another good examples in baselanguage are extension methods. Enough paddings surround elements. Make sure there is enough space between the content and its border (padding) otherwhise the editor looks too packed. More information from a design perspective can be found here . You use existing stylesheets. For baselanguage there is BaseLanguageStyle . You can search globally for instances of Stylesheet to find more styles. The font size conveys hierarchy. More information can be found in this beginner\u2019s guide to typographic hierarchy . Example hierarchy (source: Font Size And Weight Matters ) : You use the full window with for your editor. Often times the space in editor components is not good used and a lot of space is left empty on the right side of the window. This can be improved by using multiple groups next to each other or using the right hand side of the screen for some sort of legend for graphics or meta information about the (root) node (e.g. code review). Headers follow general UI principles. The following principles should be followed: hierarchical relationship of ideas consistency readability specificity More information can be found in Technical writing essentials - Headings . Headers are distinguishable from content. Bad example The header and the start of the child concepts use bold font and the same text. In this example the text \u201cOutput\u201d is redundant. The header should be larger in size. A common layout is header-input-output: At the top is the header, then there are the inputs/declarations, followed by the output/body. Make sure to separated this three groups in some ways (such as horizontal lines or empty lines). Mixed example Lines aren\u2019t too thick and not textual. A good maximum width for borders and other lines is 3 pixels. This is just a rough guideline but with thicker lines the design becomes overwhelming. Bad example You don\u2019t emphasize meta/not important information. Good example A smaller font, light gray color or maybe a different font seems to work well. Inherited value can also be shown this way: display them as placeholder values in a light gray color. Don\u2019t emphasize comments by making them bold or stand out in any way. Bad example The reflective editor is never shown. The reflective editor provides a default editor for nodes. The editor is only readonly and should only be used for debugging purposes. Bad example You use The right form of projection for the task in the editor. The right projections are used (text, tables, diagrams..) and different kind of projections are provided when necessary (switchable by menu or editor hints). Example: multiple projections You didn\u2019t forget to enable anti aliasing for custom swing components. When you create a custom component and have a paint-Method, call EditorComponent.turnOnAliasingIfPossible to enable anti aliasing. More information can be found in the Java documentation . All usages of symbols are clear. When using symbols, make sure that the user understands what it means. A Plus symbol might be easy to understand (add, increase), a complex shape that is not usuable used might be not. Common icons can be found for example in the fontawesome icon pack . You abbreviate often used words and symbol. Abbreviate words that are often used in the editor or use symbols. Examples: The Letter \u201cm\u201d or a red star * is often used to mark a field as mandatory. The plus sign \u2295 is used to indicate an \u201cadd\u201d action.","title":"UI patterns"},{"location":"patterns/ui_patterns/#ui-patterns-and-anti-patterns","text":"Go through your editors and check the following list.

You use color for emphasis and to convey information. Not only bold font can be used to emphasize words but also color. Make sure that the used color is correctly associated by the user. Bad example Greyscale editor + grey is associated with disabled content/meta information such as comments. Good example Color is used to distinguish different language features: BLUE for numbers, lila/green for CONSTANTS. You use labels in a consistent way. Labels should be used consistently in the design (e.g. always bold, colon after label), the same goes for key value pairs. There is no best practise for the separation between label and text. Some ideas and common guidelines can be found here . The context of UI elements is consistent. Counterexample: There are 3 buttons next to each other that look similar: One opens an external documentation, the other navigates to a root node and the third one undos a change. This could be confusing and frustrating for the user. A default empty statement exists. There should always be a default concept that acts as an empty line or empty text. It should be editable and support autocompletion. They should have an indicator that they are editable. The easist way is to provide a placeholder value. Bad example Different groups are distinguishable from each other. Groups can be separated for example by whitespace, by drawing a border (box) or drawing brackets around the content. You emphasize non-standard operations/literals. Emphasize special operations or literals to make it clear that they are not. Another good examples in baselanguage are extension methods. Enough paddings surround elements. Make sure there is enough space between the content and its border (padding) otherwhise the editor looks too packed. More information from a design perspective can be found here . You use existing stylesheets. For baselanguage there is BaseLanguageStyle . You can search globally for instances of Stylesheet to find more styles. The font size conveys hierarchy. More information can be found in this beginner\u2019s guide to typographic hierarchy . Example hierarchy (source: Font Size And Weight Matters ) : You use the full window with for your editor. Often times the space in editor components is not good used and a lot of space is left empty on the right side of the window. This can be improved by using multiple groups next to each other or using the right hand side of the screen for some sort of legend for graphics or meta information about the (root) node (e.g. code review). Headers follow general UI principles. The following principles should be followed: hierarchical relationship of ideas consistency readability specificity More information can be found in Technical writing essentials - Headings . Headers are distinguishable from content. Bad example The header and the start of the child concepts use bold font and the same text. In this example the text \u201cOutput\u201d is redundant. The header should be larger in size. A common layout is header-input-output: At the top is the header, then there are the inputs/declarations, followed by the output/body. Make sure to separated this three groups in some ways (such as horizontal lines or empty lines). Mixed example Lines aren\u2019t too thick and not textual. A good maximum width for borders and other lines is 3 pixels. This is just a rough guideline but with thicker lines the design becomes overwhelming. Bad example You don\u2019t emphasize meta/not important information. Good example A smaller font, light gray color or maybe a different font seems to work well. Inherited value can also be shown this way: display them as placeholder values in a light gray color. Don\u2019t emphasize comments by making them bold or stand out in any way. Bad example The reflective editor is never shown. The reflective editor provides a default editor for nodes. The editor is only readonly and should only be used for debugging purposes. Bad example You use The right form of projection for the task in the editor. The right projections are used (text, tables, diagrams..) and different kind of projections are provided when necessary (switchable by menu or editor hints). Example: multiple projections You didn\u2019t forget to enable anti aliasing for custom swing components. When you create a custom component and have a paint-Method, call EditorComponent.turnOnAliasingIfPossible to enable anti aliasing. More information can be found in the Java documentation . All usages of symbols are clear. When using symbols, make sure that the user understands what it means. A Plus symbol might be easy to understand (add, increase), a complex shape that is not usuable used might be not. Common icons can be found for example in the fontawesome icon pack . You abbreviate often used words and symbol. Abbreviate words that are often used in the editor or use symbols. Examples: The Letter \u201cm\u201d or a red star * is often used to mark a field as mandatory. The plus sign \u2295 is used to indicate an \u201cadd\u201d action.","title":"UI Patterns and Anti patterns"},{"location":"patterns/user_experience/","text":"User experience and user interfaces \u00b6 Basics \u00b6 7 Graphic Design Principles to Up-Level your Graphics 7 Gestalt Principles of Design 10 Graphic Design Rules You Should Never Break 20 Most Important UI Design Principles for UI Designer What are the basic rules of user interface design?

Understand your users\u2019 needs through goal, scenario, and task analysis. Determine a set of features that realizes these objectives. Remove unnecessary elements. Remove elements that aren\u2019t likely to be used or have preferable alternatives. Remove unnecessary redundancy. There might be several effective ways to perform a task. To achieve simplicity, make the hard decision and choose the best one for your target users instead of providing all of them and making the choice an option. Make it \u201cjust work\u201d automatically. The element is necessary, but any user interaction to get it to work is not because there is an acceptable default behavior or configuration. To achieve simplicity, make it work automatically and either hide it from the user completely or reduce its exposure significantly. Combine what should be combined. Put the essential features that support a task together so that a task can be performed in one place. The task\u2019s steps should have a unified, streamlined flow. Break down complex tasks into a set of easy, clear steps, so that \u201cone\u201d place might consist of several UI surfaces, such as a wizard. Separate what should be separated. Not everything can be presented in one place, so always have clear, well-chosen boundaries. Make features that support core scenarios central and obvious, and hide optional functionality or make it peripheral. Separate individual tasks and provide links to related tasks. For example, tasks related to manipulating photos should be clearly separated from tasks related to managing collections of photos, but they should be readily accessible from each other. Eliminate what can be eliminated. Take a printout of your design and highlight the elements used to perform the most important tasks. Even highlight the individual words in the UI text that communicate useful information. Now review what isn\u2019t highlighted and consider removing it from the design. If you remove the item, would anything bad happen? If not, remove it! Consistency, configurability, and generalization are often desirable qualities, but they can lead to unnecessary complexity. Review your design for misguided efforts in consistency (such as having redundant text), generalization (such as having any number of time zones when two is sufficient), and configurability (such as options that users aren\u2019t likely to change), and eliminate what can be eliminated. Put the elements in the right place. Within a window, an element\u2019s location should follow its utility. Essential controls, instructions, and explanations should all be in context in logical order. If more options are needed, expose them in context by clicking a chevron or similar mechanism; if more information is needed, display an infotip on mouse hover. Place less important tasks, options, and Help information outside the main flow in a separate window or page. The technique of displaying additional detail as needed is called progressive disclosure. Use meaningful high-level combinations. It is often simpler and more scalable to select and manipulate groups of related elements than individual elements. Examples of high-level combinations include folders, themes, styles, and user groups. Such combinations often map to a user goal or intention that isn\u2019t apparent from the individual elements. For example, the intention behind the High Contrast Black color scheme is far more apparent than that of a black window background. Select the right controls. Design elements are embodied by the controls you use to represent them, so selecting the right control is crucial to efficient presentation. For example, the font selection box used by Microsoft Word shows both a preview of the font as well as the most recently used fonts. Similarly, the way Word shows potential spelling and grammar errors in place is much simpler than the dialog box alternative, as shown in the beginning of this article. Make tasks discoverable and visible. All tasks, but especially frequent tasks, should be readily discoverable within the user interface. The steps required to perform tasks should be visible and should not rely on memorization. Present tasks in the user\u2019s domain. Complex software requires users to map their problems to the technology. Simple software does that mapping for them by presenting what is natural. For example, a red-eye reduction feature maps directly to the problem space and doesn\u2019t require users to think in terms of details like hues and gradients. Put domain knowledge into the program. Users shouldn\u2019t be required to access external information to use your application successfully. Domain knowledge can range from complex data and algorithms to simply making it clear what type of input is valid. Use text that users understand. Well-crafted text is crucial to effective communication with users. Use concepts and terms familiar to your users. Fully explain what is being asked in plain language so that users can make intelligent, informed decisions. Use safe, secure, probable defaults. If a setting has a value that applies to most users in most circumstances, and that setting is both safe and secure, use it as the default value. Make users specify values only when necessary. Use constraints. If there are many ways to perform a task, but only some are correct, constrain the task to those correct ways. Users should not be allowed to make readily preventable mistakes. Window UX Top Violations : Use ordinary, conversational terms when you can. Focus on the user goals, not technology. This is especially effective if you are explaining a complex technical concept or action. Imagine yourself looking over the user\u2019s shoulder and explaining how to accomplish the task. IN CONFLICT WITH Domain Be polite, supportive, and encouraging. The user should never feel condescended to, blamed, or intimidated. Remove redundant text. Look for redundant text in window titles, main instructions, supplemental instructions, content areas, command links, and commit buttons. Generally, leave full text in main instructions and interactive controls, and remove any redundancy from the other places. Use title-style capitalization for titles, and sentence-style capitalization for all other UI elements. For feature and technology names, be conservative in capitalizing. Typically, only major components should be capitalized (using title-style capitalization). For feature and technology names, be consistent in capitalizing. If the name appears more than once on a UI screen, it should always appear the same way. Likewise, across all UI screens in the program, the name should be consistently presented. Don\u2019t capitalize the names of generic user interface elements, such as toolbar, menu, scroll bar, button, and icon. Exceptions: Address bar, Links bar, ribbon. Don\u2019t use blue text that isn\u2019t a link, because users may assume that it is a link. Use bold or a shade of gray where you\u2019d otherwise use colored text. Use bold sparingly to draw attention to text users must read. Don\u2019t place periods at the end of control labels or main instructions. Use one space between sentences. Not two. Label every control or group of control For all controls, select the safest (to prevent loss of data or system access), most secure value by default. If safety and security aren\u2019t factors, select the most likely or convenient value. Use notifications for events that are unrelated to the current user activity, don\u2019t require immediate user action, and users can freely ignore. Don\u2019t abuse notifications: Use notifications only if you need to. When you display a notification, you are potentially interrupting users or even annoying them. Make sure that interruption is justified. Use notifications for non-critical events or situations that don\u2019t require immediate user action. For critical events or situations that require immediate user action, use an alternative UI element (such as a modal dialog box). Don\u2019t use notifications for feature advertisements! Never require users to click an object to determine if it is clickable. Users must be able to determine clickability by visual inspection alone. Whenever possible, propose a solution so users can fix the problem. However, make sure the proposed solution is likely to solve the problem. Don\u2019t waste users\u2019 time by suggesting possible, but improbable, solutions. Be specific. Avoid vague wording, such as syntax error and illegal operation. Provide specific names, locations, and values of the objects involved. Don\u2019t use phrasing that blames the user or implies user error. Avoid using you and your in the phrasing. While the active voice is generally preferred, use the passive voice when the user is the subject and might feel blamed for the error if the active voice were used. Don\u2019t use OK for error messages. Users don\u2019t view errors as being OK. If the error message has no direct action, use Close instead. Don\u2019t use the following words: Error, failure (use problem instead) Failed to (use unable to instead) Illegal, invalid, bad (use incorrect or not valid instead) Abort, kill, terminate (use stop instead) Catastrophic, fatal (use serious instead) Dark theme \u00b6 Use the predefined colors in MPS or define your own colors using the class JBColor with the constructor JBColor(light theme color, dark theme color) . By using this class, it shouldn\u2019t be necessary to verify if the user is using the Darcula theme . The MPS colors already support the light and dark theme because they inherit from JBColor . As seen in the screenshot below, the colors can be different when using the dark theme (for example: the white and black colors). Don\u2019t use hard-coded hex colors or the class Color . Light theme Dark theme Make sure that the foreground color is readable for the chosen background (see preceding screenshots). You can use an online contrast checker tool to verify that the color combination is readable. Example for colors with a good contrast ratio (foreground: black, the ratio can be found after the hex code): If this change isn\u2019t feasible, you can switch to the default theme (useful for RCPs): 1 2 3 4 5 6 class LookAndFeel { void set () { LafManager lafManager = LafManager . getInstance (); QuickChangeLookAndFeel . switchLafAndUpdateUI ( lafManager , LafManagerImpl . getTestInstance (). getDefaultLightLaf (), false ); } } Additional useful resources: ColorUtil (fromHex, darker, brighter, withAlpha, saturate, desaturate\u2026) MPS color definitions: MPSColors.java JBColor. brighter () + JBColor. darker () e.g. new JBColor(JBColor.PINK, JBColor.PINK.darker().darker()) IntelliJ IDEA color definitions: JBColor IntelliJ IDEA platform colors + explanation: JBUI + Platform theme colors Apple color Guidelines","title":"User experience"},{"location":"patterns/user_experience/#user-experience-and-user-interfaces","text":"","title":"User experience and user interfaces"},{"location":"patterns/user_experience/#basics","text":"7 Graphic Design Principles to Up-Level your Graphics 7 Gestalt Principles of Design 10 Graphic Design Rules You Should Never Break 20 Most Important UI Design Principles for UI Designer What are the basic rules of user interface design?

This command should build the full project and takes probably more than 10 minutes. You don\u2019t have to start this command from inside MPS but when you execute it on the normal command line, you might need to pass -PMPS_PATHS_SELECTOR to gradle to set the path to the MPS home directory.

Actions \u00b6 Build assistant \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.buildassistant This language adds actions to make or rebuild models/modules or projects and also include their dependencies. TODO: Do the official actions already provide this capability? Generic actions \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.genericactions As the name already implies, this language adds some new generic actions: Decrease MPS Editor Font Size : decreases the font size in the editor settings and updates all editors (ctrl + -) Increase MPS Editor Font Size : increases the font size in the editor settings and updates all editors (ctrl + +) Reset MPS Editor Font Size :: reset the font size to the default size (ctrl + 0, 13 pixels) File Manager in Output Folder : a new action in the context menu of models that opens the path of the generated files. This action won\u2019t work if the model doesn\u2019t generate output files. File Manager in Module Folder : a new action in the context menu of modules that opens the path of th module. Node access \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.nodeaccess This language adds a new group of actions called Copy/Paste Special to the editor popup that opens when right-clicking in the editor: Copy Node as XML : serialize the selected node to XML and copy it to the system clipboard. Paste XML Node : deserialize a previously copied node and insert it next to the current selected node. Copy Node Info to Clipboard : copies some information (project, module, model, node, URL) about a node to the system clipboard. Print \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.print.pluginSolution This language adds a new action to the general MPS File menu. The action Print Editor can be used to print the current editor with a printer. If the operating system permits it, this action can also be used to create a PDF from the editor. Refactoring \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.refactoring This language adds support for a projection mode switcher and refactoring actions. Projection mode switcher \u00b6 The mbeddr platform has a group Projection which is a top-level menu in MPS : A projection mode switcher can be declared containing push hint options where the hints are referenced from an existing ConceptEditor context hints container. The action can be added in the Add to Menu/Button Group section editor. This adds a toggle to this menu/button group that toggles the referenced editor hint in the editors. When it should only be enabled for a specific concept, add a concept to only in editor with instance of . Refactoring action \u00b6 The concept RefactoringAction can create an action for a simple refactoring . The title of the action can be specified with caption, and the keyboard shortcut can be defined in shortcut . Refactoring parameters can be specified in parameters . There are a few different choosers which will be shown in the refactoring dialog for the value of the parameters: string : chooser for selecting a text +node*: chooser for selecting a node using a filter. The filter is a function which has a list of nodes to refactor as a parameter and should return a new filtered sequence of nodes. project tree node : chooser for selecting a node from the project tree Baselanguage extensions \u00b6 BLDoc \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.bldoc This language can be used to attach a documentation via the intention Attach Documentation to any node. The richtext language provides the concept Text for writing the documentation. There are also two interfaces that implement IWord so that any node can be referenced in the com.mbeddr. doc language: @child and @root for referencing any child nodes and named nodes respectively. Richstring \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.richstring This BaseLanguage extension simplifies usage of variables and Java String.format() inside BaseLanguage Strings. Just add the language com.mbeddr.mpsutil.richstring to your model. The following example shows referencing a simple variable, embedding an expression inside a string, and the equivalent of calling String . format () : SModule \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.smodule This language adds new operations to modules: add dependencies : adds dependencies to one or more models to the module add DevKits : adds devkits to the modules add languages to the module : adds used languages to the module add model : adds a new model with the specified name to the module. The repository has to be specified as the second parameter. If you press enter after the name, you can also add devkits, references to models and languages to the newly created model. In the inspector, the storage type has to be declared: it can be per root or single file persistence. add solution : adds a new solution to the module. The virtual package can be specified (subfolder). Generator \u00b6 Generator facade \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.generatorfacade This language contains a class GeneratorFacade that helps with running the generator. In contains a method runGenerator with different signatures that can run the generator with a specific generation plan for a defined model with a custom handler for generator messages and custom generation parameters such as save transient models (default: false ) or generate in parallel (default: yes, 4 threads). GenUtil \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.genutil This language helps with managing user objects and creating temporary nodes for them: 1 createTempNode{hello -> \"world\"}; This expression creates a new node and assigns Base Language expressions to keys of it. The keys are set internally with the setref statement which takes a key, a context node (here: the newly created node) and a target expression, and creates a new user object for this node. For normal values, there are the setref and getref statements to set and retrieve values from the user object respectively. For int values, there are the statements setint and getint . Mapping labels \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.mappingLabels This language provides intentions for automatically creating mapping labels . One of the use cases is to migrate reference macros that use strings to identify target nodes to resolve the target by mapping labels instead. postprocessGeneratedFiles \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.postprocessGeneratedFiles Add a new node generated files postprocessor facet to the plugin aspect of a language to declare a new facet that is executed after files are generated (textGen). It supports post-processor functions that have a node parameter and a path parameter that contains the path of the generate file. This method can be, for example, used to copy the generated files to a different folder: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 generated files postprocessor facet testGen ( node , path ) -> void { Path target = Paths . get ( \"/var/tmp/testGen\" ). resolve ( path . getFileName ()); message info \"Copying \" + path + \" to \" + target , < no project > , < no throwable > ; try { Files . createDirectories ( target . getParent ()); Files . copy ( path , target , StandardCopyOption . REPLACE_EXISTING ); } catch ( IOException e ) { e . printStackTrace (); } } For simple duplicating the TextGen outcome, There\u2019s also the builtin JetBrains annotation CopyOutcome . XModel actions \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.xmodel.actions This language adds actions for automatically deriving generation plans . For a single or list of modules There\u2019s the action Generation Plan for Languages which can be found in the context menu that opens when you right-click the modules in the logical view. There\u2019s also an action Derive Generation Plan which derives a generation plan for a model that has to be selected in a dialog that opens when executing this action. It can be found in the same places as the text preview action (for example, in the context menu of models). Importer and exporter \u00b6 ECore \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.ecore This is an importer and exporter for the meta model( ECore ) of the Eclipse Modelling Framework. The conversion is between an XML file and a MPS model. The importer can import Ecore and Ecore model files. Access the action through right-clicking a model and opening the Ecore Transformation tools group. XML import \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.xmlImport.plugin This plugin adds two actions for importing XML files into MPS : Paste as XML Content : this action is located in the editor context menu and parses XML code and adds it to the next xml node or root node. Import XML File(s) : this actions parses on or multiple xml files and creates xml root nodes for them in the current selected model. Languages \u00b6 JSON \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.json This language implements a simple JSON language that can be used as a generator target. The Json file root node supports an additional package name which is used as the folder inside the generation folder where the file is generated into. An example for a file that can be generated: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 { \"description\" : \"This is a json file\" , \"name\" : \"my json file\" , \"this is an object\" : { \"And another object\" : { \"With a description\" : \"object description\" , \"An array\" : [ \"valu1\" , \"value2\" ], \"withANumber\" : 1.232E+231231 , \"empty array\" : [ ], \"empty object\" : { }, \"empty string\" : \"\" } } } Language extensions \u00b6 Dataflow \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.dataflow MPS -DF is a data-flow extension for MPS . Please visit the following page for more information: An Extensible Framework for Variable-precision Data-flow Analyses in MPS | Tam\u00e1s Szab\u00f3 Default values for properties \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.propertydefault This language allows setting a default value for properties when they\u2019re initialized. The default value can be set by invoking the code completion on an existing property constraint inside the concept constraints of a concept and using one of the completion items with the \u201cdefault\u201d suffix: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 concepts constraints TestPropertyDefault { ... property { bool } default : true property { int } default : 42 property { string } default : \"empty\" ... } Extension class \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.extensionclass MPS already provides a language for defining extension methods , for example, methods to be called on an object without being part of the Object\u2019s class. This language extends this mechanism to provide all static methods of a class as extension methods. They can be invoked on the type of the method\u2019s first parameter. Import the language and create a new ExtensionClass root node. Reference the Java class containing the static methods. Method annotations can be added to overwrite parameter names, so that they\u2019re more elaborate than \u201cp0\u201d or \u201cp2\u201d. As a starting point, create a dependency to the model com.mbeddr.mpsutil.extensionclass.annotation.apache.commons.lang3 which provides extension methods with useful parameter names for Apache Commons StringUtils, ObjectUtils, and StringEscapeUtils. Language plugin extensions \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil. lang .plugin.extensions This language contains extensions for jetbrains.mps. lang .plugin . It mainly adds support for adding actions not only at a specific position but also supports the anchors first, last, before and after. Example: add to NewProjectOrModuleGroup after position NewProject #Parameterized menu \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.parameterizedMenu This language is an extension to the parameterized transformation language part. When used as a menu part of it, it allows iterating over the parameter object ( parameterizable parameterized menu part) or create a dynamic submenu based on the parameter object ( parameterized submenu ). For completion styling and item priorities, use completion styling instead. Resources \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.resources This language extends the language jetbrains.mps. lang .resources by providing more customizations. CircleCustomizable adds support for drawing the circle with a different thickness. TextCustomizable adds support for specificing the font style (plain, bold, italic), font family and offsets for the text. Suppress warning \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.suppresswarning This language allows attaching an annotation to nodes to disable all or certain type system warnings by invoking the intention Toggle Suppress Warnings . There are different kinds of warnings that can be suppressed: all : suppress all warnings In com.mbeddr.core.modules two more data flow specific kinds exist: liveness : suppress dataflow liveness warning dataflow : suppress dataflow warning Type system trace \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.typesystem.trace This language currently doesn\u2019t work anymore. This language modifies the different typesystem concepts like comparison rule, non typesystem rules etc. to collect information about the runtime execution time. To use it, place an instance of TraceTypesystem into a typesystem aspect to include the generator of this language and set the enabled flag to true. The model contains a new action Benchmark Typesystem that opens a tool named Type System Performance Data that shows the collected information. XML fix \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.xml.fix This language contains fixes for the XML language . It escapes XMl values for XML 1.0/1.1. Unique names \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.uniquenames MPS references all nodes by their id , not their name. Still, as humans, we see only the name, and this might be ambiguous. The Unique Names hint can be activated in MPS Preferences, Editor Hints. It shows as much of the full qualified name as required rendering a name unique. Example concept: Example Base Language: Tools \u00b6 Context actions \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.contextactions There\u2019s a Context Actions (JetBrains) and Context Actions 2 (mbeddr) tool. Please use the one from JetBrains instead of this language. This language adds a tool with context-specific editor actions that can be navigated by mouse. For more information about the JetBrains implementation, visit the page Context acions tool | MPS Editing guide \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.editingGuide This language allows creating interactive exercises for the end users that can be checked on the fly. An exercise contains a number of tasks and contain a reference to a following exercise. A single task contains a name, a description as well as the code block that should be shown in the exercise. The monitor function checks the completion status of the task. The variable program refers to the code section, the editorContext can be used, for example, to get the selected cell by calling editorContext.getSelectedCell() . The following objects can be returned: MonitorResultDone : the task was completed successfully, and the explanation is shown. MonitorResultError : the task was completed with an error. MonitorResultHint : the task was not completed successfully, and a hint is shown. The task can\u2019t be started by clicking the play button next to the name of a task. A new temporary model is created which contains the editable task. Favourites plugin \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.favourites.plugin The favourites view is implemented using the language com.mbeddr.mpsutil.projectview from MPS -extensions . There\u2019s an action Add to Favourites to add a node to this view. The node can be removed by executing the action Remove from Favourites . Internally, the plugin is implemented using node annotations. Generated artifacts review \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.genreview This language might not work correctly anymore. This tool can be used to view artifacts that where generated by a generator. It has a special color mapping for Java files. The button Highlight lines not linked should highlight the lines which aren\u2019t related to any node. When multiple original nodes can be traced to a certain file and line, the previous and next button can be used to navigate to these nodes. Graphstream \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.graphstream This language adds support for GraphStream , a dynamic Java graph library. It can show a graph inside a tool called Graphing . Have a look at the language com.mbeddr.mpsutil.graphstream.example to see how a graph can be loaded. A concept has to implement the interface GraphingElement . When the current selected node implements the interface, a new menu View Graph appears in the editor context menu. The tool itself has support for history, zooming, fitting the view and rendering the graph as a GraphViz SVG. JUNG framework \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.jung As an additional means of displaying relationships between nodes (next to PlantUML and the tree views) the JUNG framework was integrated displaying graph. As a language developer, you can implement an interface IJGraphProvider and implement a method that creates the graph: programmable with high-level API specify initial layout configurable node size, color, line style and color, fill color, shape and label configurable edge width, style, color and label configurable tooltip text for nodes and edges extensibility to plug in your own layouters (such as the one from yWorks) Once you have created a graph, your users have many options for viewing the graph in an MPS tool window: double-click selects node or edge in editor zoom and pan tooltips selectable layouts selection and highlighting of outgoing and incoming nodes and edges filtering based on node and edge type filtering along a continuous axis (for example, time) incremental, node-based collapsing and expansion The JUNG integration is available as part of mbeddr, but also as part of the mbeddr.platform, so you can use it for your own languages. Check out the Chunk node for an example of how to use it. A demo video of the viewer can be found here . To use it in your own language, implement the IJGraphProvider interface. Return a JNGraph from the getGraph() method. Check out the existing implementations, and in particular the DepGraphHelper (called from Chunk.getGraph()) to learn the details. In short, a graph is built in two steps: the first step actually adds the nodes and edges. The second step uses closures to style the graph. Examples can be seen from DepGraphHelper. PlantUML \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.plantuml.node This provides an integration of PlantUML with MPS . Watch this old video to get an overview. To use it in your own languages, implement the IVisualizable interface in your language concept. Each concept can have several visualizations, called categories. The getCategories() method returns the list (just strings). The getVisualization() method then returns the actual visualization. It gets the user-requested category as an argument, as well as an empty VisGraph object. The getVisualization() method then has to fill the VisGraph with the actual visualization. This is done simply by using the add() method to build a native, textual PlantUML visualization. Check out the existing implementations of the interface to learn the deails; in particular, There\u2019s a helper method on VisGraph that creates a URL for users to click in the graph: createUrl(node) . Tool runner \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.toolrunner.plugin This solution provides an extension point ToolsSanityCheckerProvider that allows registering instances of ToolsAvailabilityChecker This interface checks the availability of external tools and their proper configuration and can be called through ToolsInstallationSanityChecker.check . There\u2019s also a class ToolRunnerBase , a base class for running external tools. It supports running the tool with a progress indicator, a customizable timeout and reading the (error) output. Trace explorer \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.traceExplorer This language contributes a new tool Trace Explorer than can show and navigate traces of a model e.g. from the interpreter. An example can be seen in the KernelF paper . The IETS3 tracing is explained on the interpreter page . UI \u00b6 Cells \u00b6 AsyncCell \u00b6 The async cell allows displaying a text based loading indicator as long as the return string is null. Create a new $custom cell$ editor cell and return a new AsyncCellProvider: 1 2 3 4 5 6 return new AsyncCellProvider ( node , { => string value = calculateValue (); // calculate or query your value here if ( value . isEmpty ) { return null ; } Style style = editorContext . ? getContextCell (). ? getStyle (); return new AsyncCellValue ( value , style ); }); FrameCell \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.framecell frame is a special editor cell collection that draws a top and bottom border around its contained cell. It supports the following style attributes: frame-color : the color of the frame (default: black) frame-width : the thickness of the frame (default: 1 pixel) frame-padding : the space between the containting cell and the frame (default: 3 pixel) An example can be seen in the documentation language: In most cases, the language de.itemis.mps.editor.celllayout from MPS -extensions can also be used for customizing the border and margins around a cell. Its documentation can be found here . Margin cell / review \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.margincell and com.mbeddr.mpsutil.review Margin cells are editor cells that are shown beyond the right editor margin, a little bit like comments in Word. In fact, the ReviewNote cell implements exactly Word\u2019s comment facility as an example of the margin cell. Here is a screenshot: To use the review notes, just include the respective language; intentions are available to attach review notes to editor cells. To put your own cells into the right margin, your cell must implement the IMarginCellContent interface. The editor of your cell may use the margincell-cell-width and margincell-dashed-line-interval style attributes to design the width and line style. You also have to have the actual margin cell on the root element of the editor. However, as illustrated by the CommentAnnotationContainer from the review language, you can use an annotation for this. Hence, margin comments can essentially be added to every model, without the model\u2019s language being aware of it. Placeholder text list \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.placeholderTextList This language adds a new cell model that supports multiple aggregation with a custom placeholder text. The placeholder can be specified in the inspector by creating a query function for the placeholder text . Diagrams \u00b6 Concept diagram \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.conceptdiagram Create a new root node of type ConceptDiagram . The editor should now contain an empty editor. Nodes can be dragged from the Diagram Palette to the diagram. If nodes from other languages are needed, add the language to the languages section. Dependencies diagram \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.dependenciesdiagram This language contains a concept DependenciesDiagram Drag a model or module reference from the diagram palette to the diagram. Dependencies to other models/modules will be automatically added. The dependencies is visualized by the line between the two boxes, and its label is named after the scope of the dependency (e.g. uses if the language is imported). Date picker \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.datepicker A classic widget to select a date from a pop-up calendar. There\u2019s a known issue where the datepicker doesn\u2019t work when the theme is set to macOS light. This is only the control, i.e. the developer is responsible for synchronizing the control with the source of the shown date. We provide hooks executed before showing the calendar, for determining whether a date is valid, and to process a selected date. Editor utils \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.editor.utils The class EditorRuntimeUtil contains a few helpful editor utility methods: getErrorText(EditorContext) : returns the error text of the current selected cell in the editor collectAllOpenEditors(Project) : returns all opened MPS editors collectAllOpenEditorComponents(Project) : return all opened editor components File picker \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.filepicker This language contains text-based file and folder pickers. The paths can be directly entered in the editor. There\u2019s also an intention Open File Chooser Dialog that shows a file chooser dialog. The following file pickers are supported: file system dir picker file system file picker macro file picker macro folder picker solution relative dir picker solution relative file picker The macro pickers can contain path variables . Hyperlink \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.hyperlink Hyperlink cells can be used for references in MPS . In contrast to normal reference cells they automatically become blue and underlined if the mouse hovers over them (no Ctrl is necessary). The following style attributes are supported: hyperlink-reference : make a reference a hyperlink hyperlink-handler : a function that\u2019s called when the link is clicked. The util parameter object contains a method openInBrowser for opening an URL with the default web browser. hyperlink-style : can be URl or reference. The reference style forces the use of ctrl to activate the hyperlink. hyperlink-node : the node that should be displayed after the link was clicked hyperlink-focus : focus the target node of the hyperlink after navigating to it. hyperlink-select : select the target node of the hyperlink after navigating to it. JFreeChart \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.jfreechart This module contains stubs for the jfreechart library. The charts can be viewed in an extra tool Chart by calling the following code: 1 ChartManager . getInstance ( editorContext ). setChart ( node . createChart ()) where createChart return instance of JFreeChart . Target chooser \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.targetchooser The target chooser language provides a modal dialog for choosing nodes based on a predefined scope: Example code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 TargetChooserOptions options = new TargetChooserOptions (); project . getModelAccess (). runReadAction ({ => options . setScope ( new arraylist < node <>> { node / TargetChooser / , node / TargetChooserDialog / , node / DefaultModuleScope / }); }); TargetChooser chooser = new TargetChooser ( ProjectHelper . toIdeaProject ( project ), options ); TargetChooserDialog . chooseTarget ( # project , options ) The options object has the following setters: setInitial : set the initial selected item. This can be a node or a model. setSelectionValidator : the selection validator checks if the selected target is valid or shows an error message when it\u2019s invalid. By default, no validation takes places (an empty validator is used). setSNodeFilter : this filter decides which nodes should be visible in the dialog (within the selected scope). To show a node, you also have to return true for the root node, but not for all ancestors. setModuleScope : this scope defines the available modules that will be the sources for the nodes that will be displayed. addModuleFilter : an additional boolean filter for the modules of the module scope. showModulesPool : a flag that decides if the modules pool (last entry in logical view) should also be displayed in the dialog. setModelFilter : only keep the models of the specified scope where the filter returns true setScope : sets the scope for the items that should be displayed in the dialog. This can be in instance of TargetChooserScope or a sequence of nodes (+ ancestor filter). By default, the specified modules scope with the specified model and node filers applied is used. User styles \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.userstyles This language provides a new annotation @userConfigurable , that can be added to a style class in a style sheet (intention: Make User Configurable ). After defining a name, the user can change the style in the preferences ( Preferences \u2192 Editor \u2192 Color Scheme \u2192 Code ). The following style-class items are supported: Foreground : equivalent to text-foreground-color Background : equivalent to text-background-color Bold : equivalent to font-style: bold Italic : equivalent to *font-style: italic Effects: Dotted lines, bold underscored, underscored, underwaved : equivalent to underlined Effects: strikeout : equivalent to strike-out Further useful links for developers: Export IntelliJ editor themes as plugin | JetBrains blog UI Themes \u2014 Editor Schemes and Background Images | IntelliJ Platform Plugin SDK Testing \u00b6 Lantest \u00b6 This language isn\u2019t working anymore. com.mbeddr.mpsutil.lantest This language was an attempt to automatically test languages, for example, check if the generation of files finished successfully or check that existing models can be instantiated again via the editor (for example: discover bugs in constraints). Test utils \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.test.util The class ModelAsserter can be used to compare models inside a test case. When the two models don\u2019t match, it shows the difference between the models. Wait for \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.blutil.test.waitfor This language contains a assert item wait for for tests, the waits for an expression to become true. If the condition evaluates to false, the check is repeated every m millisecond until the timeout of n milliseconds is reached. Both m and n can be set in the inspector of the statement. A use case for this statement could be a multithreaded code, where you have to wait for the result of a different thread: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 boolean enoughTimeHasElapsed; ApplicationManager.getApplication().executeOnPooledThread({ => try { Thread.sleep(50); } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } enoughTimeHasElapsed = true; }); wait for enoughTimeHasElapsed; Plugin and RCP \u00b6 Actions filter \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.actionsfilter MPS contains a lot of actions that might be not needed by end users such as actions for language development and actions of the IDE platform. This language allows disabling actions inside a MPS plugin solution by defining an actions profile. active by default can be set including an activation condition to make this profile the active profile when opening the project or RCP . All actions are disabled in a tree view and can be selected to disable them. To allow actions instead of filtering them use the intention Use allow actions on the actions profile. Actions in the section specify toolbar are displayed in the main toolbar that\u2019s located at the top left of the window. To use the language, not only the language has to be installed but also the corresponding Intellij plugin. ./gradlew install can install this plugin. Without the plugin the language won\u2019t load at all. Development tip: when making changes to the language, make sure to disable the plugin in the preferences, so that the model is not readonly. Execute ./gradlew install to install the plugin after making a change and restart MPS to test it. The predefined actions profiles can be customized by the user in preferences \u2192 Appearance & Behavior \u2192 Actions . New profiles can be created by clicking the + button and deleted by clicking the - button. Preference form \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.preferenceform This language allows adding new preference pages to Preferences \u2192 Other Settings . The language uses the IntelliJ platform mechanism for adding preference pages ( documentation ). Example: It supports the following options: scope : save the preferences on application or project level help topic : The help topic is an internal identifier that can link a page in the MPS documentation. Example: preferences.intentionPowerPack links to https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/webhelp/?preferences.intentionPowerPack which redirects to https://www.jetbrains.com/help/mps/intentions-settings.html . The base URL in MPS is defined the XML configuration of a few plugins. To get the other internal names search for getHelpTopic in the MPS repository ) and/or the IntelliJ Community repository . The preference form supports a few different input elements: password field checkbox dynamic combo box integer field predefined combo box text field The before write method is called, when the button Apply or OK is pressed. This method should update all tools or classes that reference the values of the preference form. The input fields can be accessed through the this object. Example: 1 2 3 final HttpServerConfig config = new HttpServerConfig ((( int ) this . port ), this . enabled ); HttpServerConfig . setCurrentConfig ( config ); extensionPoint / HttpServerConfigChangeListener / . objects . forEach ({ ~ it => it . serverChanged ( config ); }); The after read method is called, after the state is loaded (for example: when the preference form is opened). Wizard (process) \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.process This language allows creating wizards with multiple steps: Create a new node of instance Process . The wizard can have input parameters and produces one output. After defining the wizard it can be invoked from an action. Example: 1 2 3 4 wizard<theProcess> wiz = createWizard<theProcess>(\"This is my testdata\"); boolean b = wiz.show; System.out.println(\"show == \" + b); wiz.finish; The show method shows the modal dialog and checks if it was closed with the exit code OK .

New Model ( RCP ) \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.rcp This language allows creating a new action for creating models similar to the action New model of mbeddr. Create an instance of NewModelDialogConfig . The following settings are supported: name : the name of the new action caption : the text that\u2019s shown for the action user can change persistence : boolean flag that decides if the user can change the model\u2019s persistence type. default persistence : the type of model persistence that\u2019s used when the model is created optional devkits : devkits that are automatically added when the model is created show model properties : open the model properties after the model was created SPreferences \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.spreferences This extension allows the definition of preference pages by using MPS models; so in the preference page you get a normal MPS editor, as exemplified by mbeddr\u2019s platform templates preference page: Such pages are defined using an instance of PreferencePageDescription (check out the root \u201cPlatform Templates\u201d as an example). This instance must reside in a plugin solution. The data, i.e., the respective MPS model, is stored as part of the respective project or in MPS globally (this is configurable). It is possible to access the model that contains the preferences via code: Deprecated \u00b6 Build utilities \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.buildutil This language was an attempt to automatically update build scripts during the build.

Make \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.make This plugin contains old fixes for rebuilding models/modules and projects that are already included in MPS . The plugin will be removed soon. Multilingual \u00b6 This language might be removed in the future. com.mbeddr.mpsutil.multilingual The idea behind this language was to store text translations in properties files and load the through the Java ResourceBundle class. The documentation for the language can be found here as a PDF and is located in the virtual package doc .com.mbeddr.mpsutil . Node difference \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.nodediff These actions were used to structurally compare two nodes and are deprecated. Please use the official action Compare Two Nodes instead.

Mbeddr \u00b6 Base \u00b6 Assessement \u00b6 To extend assessements, extend the class AssessmentQuery to create a new query. The result of the query has to extend the class AssessmentResult . The interface AssessmentSummary must also be extended to provide an summary of the results. Example: Chunk \u00b6 A node of the class Chunk has several properties: it has a name, acts as a scope provider for elements, can import other elements or vice versa. It also integrates with the tree view and provides a graph of all the chunk hierarchy including imports. It also detects dependency cycles. Example: ICommentable \u00b6 Concepts or interfaces that implement ICommentable can be commented out by typing // or /* as long as it is not trigger by a node that implements IEmpty . IDocumentable \u00b6 Add support for documentating nodes when implementing the IDocumentable interface. The text node is using the language de.slisson.mps.richtext and supported text and embedded nodes. ITreeViewable \u00b6 Implement the interface [ITreeViewRoot] to use the Tree tool. It is a tool that can show a tree structure when this interface is implemented. Example: IETS3 call tree of functions IContainerOfUniqueNames \u00b6 The interface IContainerOfUniqueNames checks that the provided names are indeed unique and shows and error otherwise. For qualified names, implement the interface IHasQualifiedName . IDetectCycle \u00b6 The interface IDetectCycle can be implemented to detect cyclic dependencies. This feature is used, for example, with chunks that import other chunks. IEmpty \u00b6 The interface IEmpty can be implemented to support empty lines. Error messages are automatically supressed and the node is also not shown in the outline. Name related interfaces \u00b6 The interface IIdentifierNamedConcept can be used for concept that should have a valid identifier. Check the property constraint to unterstand how it works. The interface INameAllUpperCase , INameFirstCharLowerCase and INameFirstCharUpperCase can be used to further constraint the identifier name. IMbeddrIDERoot \u00b6 Concepts that implement the interface IMbeddrIDERoot show up in the New Roots menu thats shown above the normal new menu of the context menu. It adds the following features: custom name for the menu entry, root concept sorting and custom categories for the root concepts. IETS3 \u00b6 General \u00b6 ISolvable \u00b6 The interface ISolvable can be implemented to create solver tasks that could be executed by a solver such as Z3 . To enable the solver for a node, implement the interface IUseSolver . A solver task must extend the concept AbstractSolverTask . The concept that can be mapped to the solver must implement ICanBeMappedToSolver . ICanRunCheckManually \u00b6 The interface ICanRunCheckManually can be implemented to support running checks that are executed through one of the actions (runAllManuallyOnModel, runAllManuallyOnRoot, runManuallyOnContainer etc.) or are executed through intentions. The result of a check can be stored as a user object of a node. The interface also supports updating the editor with the test results, for example, highlighting the background of a test with a color and refreshing the editor. Example: IOptionallyNamed \u00b6 Use the interface IOptionallyNamed for concepts that should support an optional name. You can also use this name in smart references. IValidNamedConcept \u00b6 As an alternative to the mbeddr interfaces, you can use the interface IValidNamedConcept for valid identifiers that are valid in KernelF. Expressions \u00b6 To add a new expression, extend the concept Expression . The new concept can be commented out and documented by default. ICanBeLValue \u00b6 Implement the interface ICanBeLValue when the concept can be used as the left value of expressions such as assignments. Variable references, paths and dot expression can be left values. IDotTarget \u00b6 Implement the interface IDotTarget to support custom operations for the dot expression. It can be used, for example, to add new operations for collections, enumerations, math, statemachines and many more. IEmptyLiteral \u00b6 The interface IEmptyLiteral is a marker interface used to mark literals that at runtime evaluate to an empty value. ILiteral \u00b6 Implement the interface ILiteral to add support for a new literal. For primitive types such as integers and strings, extend the concept PrimitiveLiteral instead. Register an extension for the primitiveTypeMapper extension point when using custom primitive literals. The standard implementation is the SimpleTypesPrimitiveTypeMapper . Effects \u00b6 Since KernelF is by default immutable, there are some language extensions that allow side effects such as the language org.iets3.core. expr .mutable . To add custom concepts that have affects, implement the interfaces IMayAllowEffect and IMayHaveEffect . IOptionallyTyped \u00b6 Use the interface IOptionallyTyped to add an optional type to an expression. The expression automatically used the provided type as its own type. ITraceRoot \u00b6 Nodes that want to be the root of tracing , should implement the interface ITraceRoot Custom types \u00b6 Custom types must extend the concept Type . If the type supports a default value (e.g. false for the boolean type and 0 for a numeric type), also implement the interface ITypeSupportsDefaultValue . IWantNewLine \u00b6 The concepts of expressions that need to be on a new line such as try expressions, block expressions and sometimes tables, need to implement the interface IWantNewLine . This interface affects the layout of some expressions such as if expressions and function bodies. Tests \u00b6 To add a new test statement, extend the concept AbstractTestItem . If the editor needs to be updated after the test item was executed, override the method performAdditionalEditorUpdate . Top-level \u00b6 IToplevelExprContent \u00b6 Implement the interface IToplevelExprContent to allow an expression to be used at the topmost level similar to the ExpressionStatement in baselanguage . Collections \u00b6 When implementing custom operations for collections such as maps, lists and sets, use one of the provided concepts as the base concept (for example NoArgCollectionOp and OneArgCollectionOp ). If there is no suitable concept, implement one of the interfaces such as ICollectionOp and IMapOneArgOp . If this is still not possible, you can still implement IDotTarget directly. MPS -extensions \u00b6 Richtext \u00b6 IWord \u00b6 Implement the interface IWord to add new embeddable nodes to the text.","title":"Common concepts and interfaces"},{"location":"platform_essentials/common_concepts_and_interfaces/#mbeddr","text":"","title":"Mbeddr"},{"location":"platform_essentials/common_concepts_and_interfaces/#base","text":"","title":"Base"},{"location":"platform_essentials/common_concepts_and_interfaces/#assessement","text":"To extend assessements, extend the class AssessmentQuery to create a new query.

It takes IETS3 as an example. It mostly uses the MPS GUI for Git. If you want to do everything on the command line, checkout An introduction to Git or one of the Git cheatsheets . Make sure that you have Git and Java 11 installed. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/IETS3/iets3.opensource.git or Check out a project from a remote host for the GUI way. Decide which branch you want to use a the template for the contribution. The supported MPS version should be listed in the README. Older branches are named maintenance/mpsX, e.g. maintenance/mps20203, the main branch is the master branch. If you have already checked out the repository before, make sure to fetch all the changes from the remote repository. Create a new branch from the selected branch . Some common names are feature/X, bugfix/X and refactoring/X where X stands for a description of the branch and maybe the targeted MPS version such as feature/myfeature_20211. Push the changes to the repository. Editing the repository history is only allowed on your on branch. Create a new pull request in the remote repository. Optionally, request a pull request review if the repository requires reviewing. Make sure that the build runs on https://build.mbeddr.com . The status can be viewed in the PR . If the reviewer requires a change, make the change and click the rerequest review button. If the reviewer approves the change, you can merge the changes (or he has already merged your changes). If you have a lot of commits, that you want to merge into one commit or several commits, you can either use interactive rebase in MPS or squash your commits into one single commit when merging the pull request. Some more tips: Enable GitHub notifications to receive mail notifications about events on GitHub such as comments, or approved pull requests. The browser extension Refined GitHub provides some additional features for GitHub that you might find useful.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"platform_essentials/interpreter/","text":"The interpreter let you interpret code on the fly. You can use it instead of the normal approach by writing an MPS generator and executing the code this way (e.g. executing baselanguage code). The result of invoking the interpreter is a Java object. In the GIF you can see the interpreter executing a test case that contains assertions that are writing with KernelF . The MPS generator isn\u2019t involved in the execution at all. Creating an interpreter \u00b6 First you have to import the language com.mbeddr.mpsutil.interpreter . Now create a new interpreter and give it a name. The category should be arithmetic so that other interpreters of this category can also use this interpreter but you can also use other categories. There is, for example a demo Java interpreter in mpsutils(mbeddr) that uses its own category java . You don\u2019t have to set the evaluated languages: they are automatically calculated based on the declared evaluators. In the related interpreter section, you can define that the current interpret should run before or after another interpreter. An example from KernelF: the collections operations should be interpreted first because they are reduced to simpler statements. The lambda and base interpreter should be run afterwards. The type mappings section can declare mappings from types that implement the IType interface to either a java type or another custom type that implements the IType interface. An evalutator consists of a left and right side: the left side is a concept that should be interpreted. In the inspector, you can set cacheValues to true to enabling caching. When the same value is accessed again, the cached value is returned instead of recalculation a value. The interpreter cache can be disabled by unchecking Tools \u2192 Enable Interpreter Cache in the main menu. The right side contains is an expression or a block and must return a value. The node expression refers to the currently evaluated expression. There are a few expressions starting with \u2018#\u2019, that are explained in their corresponding short descriptions. The \u2018#->\u2019 expression is used to call functions (search for usages globally). The right side can return a Java object (including null) or call another interpreter with one of the #-expressions. Another interesting expressions is the env expression. It\u2019s an array that can be used to save values for other evalulators. The key must be a node. If you don\u2019t have a node available, you can also use a helper class with static dummy nodes as keys. An example could be a dot expression where the operation needs to access the operand e.g. \"hello\".startswith(\"he\") . startswith() is the operation, \"hello\" is the operand: In case that the current interpreter is not suitable for interpreting the current node, the expression tryOtherInterpreter can be used to use the next interpreter to interpret the current node: The castUp expression can be used to case a Java (baselanguage) expression to a type. For example, if the expression is of type Number (numberInput) and the target type is float, numberInput.floatValue() would be called. The $ expression returns the type of a concept. It can be used for type mappings but also for child type constraints that can be entered in the middle of evaluators. For example: the evalator of a modulo operator might require that the left and right expressions are of type integer otherwise the evaluator shouldn\u2019t be used: The context expression can be used to access the interpreter configurations, the cache, the root interpreter and contains some other useful. It can, for example, be used to access the environment from a Java class by executing a method with the context as a parameter. Then the environment can be accessed by calling context.getEnvironment() . The environment can be nested by calling push and pop . The topmost environment in the stack is used. The is evaluable expression (#?) can be used to check if there is an evaluator available for a specific node. Code coverage \u00b6 There\u2019s also support for coverage that\u2019s displayed inside the editor. Code coverage checks which part of the code was executed by the interpreter. For more information, consult the Wikipedia page . This way you can, for example, find out which parts of the code aren\u2019t covered by tests: There\u2019s support for coverage of single nodes but also branches. An example for branches would be, for example, the if and else block of an if statement. To register branches use the register branches statement. To visit a branch, use the branch statement. When visiting a node, the node, the node\u2019s concept and the evaluator are automatically marked as covered. For the children of the node, there\u2019s the list coverage statement which visits a list of nodes and there\u2019s also the simple cover statement. The former is, for example, used for the elements of a map literal. The coverage information can be accessed and set through the coverage variable. Tracing in KernelF \u00b6 To follow the executing of an interpreter, the execution trace is helpful. Right-click an interpreted node and click Show Trace . The Trace explorer now opens in the lower left corner. When you click onww of the lines in the trace explorer, the node in the editor gets replaced by the trace. The trace can be manipulated through the trace expression . Nix handling in KernelF \u00b6 KernelF doesn\u2019t allow returning null values (intermediate null values that are caught by the same or other evaluators are fine). Instead it supports so called nix handlers (there\u2019s an nixHandler extension point ). The default handler for KernelF is DefaultNixHandler . A nix value (interface INixValue ) repesents an empty (nothing) value. There is, for example, a DefaultNix class, for dates there\u2019s EmptyDateRangeValue . The handler has a method process that can be used to handle values that might be nix. To use this feature. To use this feature call new NixSupport(Object value node<> node {NixSupport => Object} calculator).run() where the calculator returns the value: Calling the interpreter \u00b6 For IETS3 use the class IETS3ExprEvalHelper . If you can\u2019t use this class, use the following code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 class Coverage { void test () { ICoverage coverage = null ; // your implementation ContextImpl ctx = new ContextImpl (); InterpreterEvaluationHelper helper = new InterpreterEvaluationHelper ( INTERPRETER_CATEGORY ); return helper . evaluateWithContextAndCoverage ( expr , getInterpreter (), ctx , coverage ); } } There are also methods which don\u2019t need coverage, a context object and so forth. The easiest method is helper.evaluate which returns a Java expression. Final notes \u00b6 The interpreter doesn\u2019t support multithreading. It can also be slow when called too many times. It\u2019s also recommended to not call the interpreter from the generator because when searching for interpreters, MPS might deadlock because it starts indexing. You might get away with it by calling the interpreter inside the runnable of DumbService.getInstance(project).suspendIndexingAndRun() . You can\u2019t return the value from the runnable, but you can assign it in a method of an object that\u2019s outside the runnable.

For more information about the JetBrains implementation, visit the page Context acions tool | MPS Editing guide \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.editingGuide This language allows creating interactive exercises for the end users that can be checked on the fly. An exercise contains a number of tasks and contain a reference to a following exercise. A single task contains a name, a description as well as the code block that should be shown in the exercise. The monitor function checks the completion status of the task. The variable program refers to the code section, the editorContext can be used, for example, to get the selected cell by calling editorContext.getSelectedCell() . The following objects can be returned: MonitorResultDone : the task was completed successfully, and the explanation is shown. MonitorResultError : the task was completed with an error. MonitorResultHint : the task was not completed successfully, and a hint is shown. The task can\u2019t be started by clicking the play button next to the name of a task. A new temporary model is created which contains the editable task. Favourites plugin \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.favourites.plugin The favourites view is implemented using the language com.mbeddr.mpsutil.projectview from MPS -extensions . There\u2019s an action Add to Favourites to add a node to this view. The node can be removed by executing the action Remove from Favourites . Internally, the plugin is implemented using node annotations. Generated artifacts review \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.genreview This language might not work correctly anymore. This tool can be used to view artifacts that where generated by a generator. It has a special color mapping for Java files. The button Highlight lines not linked should highlight the lines which aren\u2019t related to any node. When multiple original nodes can be traced to a certain file and line, the previous and next button can be used to navigate to these nodes. Graphstream \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.graphstream This language adds support for GraphStream , a dynamic Java graph library. It can show a graph inside a tool called Graphing . Have a look at the language com.mbeddr.mpsutil.graphstream.example to see how a graph can be loaded. A concept has to implement the interface GraphingElement . When the current selected node implements the interface, a new menu View Graph appears in the editor context menu. The tool itself has support for history, zooming, fitting the view and rendering the graph as a GraphViz SVG. JUNG framework \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.jung As an additional means of displaying relationships between nodes (next to PlantUML and the tree views) the JUNG framework was integrated displaying graph. As a language developer, you can implement an interface IJGraphProvider and implement a method that creates the graph: programmable with high-level API specify initial layout configurable node size, color, line style and color, fill color, shape and label configurable edge width, style, color and label configurable tooltip text for nodes and edges extensibility to plug in your own layouters (such as the one from yWorks) Once you have created a graph, your users have many options for viewing the graph in an MPS tool window: double-click selects node or edge in editor zoom and pan tooltips selectable layouts selection and highlighting of outgoing and incoming nodes and edges filtering based on node and edge type filtering along a continuous axis (for example, time) incremental, node-based collapsing and expansion The JUNG integration is available as part of mbeddr, but also as part of the mbeddr.platform, so you can use it for your own languages. Check out the Chunk node for an example of how to use it. A demo video of the viewer can be found here . To use it in your own language, implement the IJGraphProvider interface. Return a JNGraph from the getGraph() method. Check out the existing implementations, and in particular the DepGraphHelper (called from Chunk.getGraph()) to learn the details. In short, a graph is built in two steps: the first step actually adds the nodes and edges. The second step uses closures to style the graph. Examples can be seen from DepGraphHelper. PlantUML \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.plantuml.node This provides an integration of PlantUML with MPS . Watch this old video to get an overview. To use it in your own languages, implement the IVisualizable interface in your language concept. Each concept can have several visualizations, called categories. The getCategories() method returns the list (just strings). The getVisualization() method then returns the actual visualization. It gets the user-requested category as an argument, as well as an empty VisGraph object. The getVisualization() method then has to fill the VisGraph with the actual visualization. This is done simply by using the add() method to build a native, textual PlantUML visualization. Check out the existing implementations of the interface to learn the deails; in particular, There\u2019s a helper method on VisGraph that creates a URL for users to click in the graph: createUrl(node) . Tool runner \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.toolrunner.plugin This solution provides an extension point ToolsSanityCheckerProvider that allows registering instances of ToolsAvailabilityChecker This interface checks the availability of external tools and their proper configuration and can be called through ToolsInstallationSanityChecker.check . There\u2019s also a class ToolRunnerBase , a base class for running external tools. It supports running the tool with a progress indicator, a customizable timeout and reading the (error) output. Trace explorer \u00b6 com.mbeddr.mpsutil.traceExplorer This language contributes a new tool Trace Explorer than can show and navigate traces of a model e.g. from the interpreter.

Check out the Chunk node for an example of how to use it. A demo video of the viewer can be found here . To use it in your own language, implement the IJGraphProvider interface. Return a JNGraph from the getGraph() method. Check out the existing implementations, and in particular the DepGraphHelper (called from Chunk.getGraph()) to learn the details.

Here is a screenshot: To use the review notes, just include the respective language; intentions are available to attach review notes to editor cells. To put your own cells into the right margin, your cell must implement the IMarginCellContent interface. The editor of your cell may use the margincell-cell-width and margincell-dashed-line-interval style attributes to design the width and line style. You also have to have the actual margin cell on the root element of the editor. However, as illustrated by the CommentAnnotationContainer from the review language, you can use an annotation for this. Hence, margin comments can essentially be added to every model, without the model\u2019s language being aware of it.

Language engineering with MPS \u00b6 If you want to become proficient with language engineering based on MPS , the best approach is to build stuff, work with people and ask questions. The MPS team at itemis is a good environment for doing this. However, we have written a lof of stuff over time. And to increase overall efficiency and to be respectful of the time of the team members, it is recommended to read a few things in advance/in parallel. In this document we describe a list of recommended readings. I suggest you start with the book on DSL Engineering. It\u2019s available as a free PDF from voelter.de/books . In the first part, it discusses some general characterizations of DSLs. Part two is on language design; you should become proficient in the design concerns discussed there. Part three is about language implementation with different tools; you can skip the non- MPS parts, if you want to. The MPS -specific explanations are not quite up to date, but the concepts and approaches explained there are still relevant. One recent extension to MPS we use all the time now is grammar cells, a way to more easily build usable editors for textual notation. We strongly suggest reading this paper: GrammarCells . Next, you may want to take a look at the MPS books by Fabien Campagne . They are essentially a beginner\u2019s guide to language development with MPS . Whenever you want to do something specific, then looking at how to do it in those books is a good starting point for deeper discussions with the colleagues (note: the official documentation might be a better starting point because these book might be outdated in some aspects.) The documentation page also contains videos and tutorials on a variety of specific MPS -related topics. Over the years we have built a lot of useful extensions and utilities to MPS . They are described on the mbeddr platform page. Most of those are not really documented, but you can find examples for all (relevant and stable) utilities in mbeddr itself. Finally, to understand the experiences we have made with MPS over the years, you may want to read this draft paper: Lessons Learned from Developing mbeddr . Working on (extending) mbeddr \u00b6 If, in addition to working with MPS in general, you plan to work on the mbeddr languages, there is more reading we suggest. We suggest reading parts of Markus\u2019 thesis, because it is the most comprehensive and up-to-date description of mbeddr: Generic Tools, Specific Languages .

Implicitly, this also gives you a good starting point to understand the structure of mbeddr, as well as how and where to \u201chook in\u201d for building extensions.
