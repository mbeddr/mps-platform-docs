Why is this so and how to fix it?</p> <p>Reason for the Problem</p> <p>In general the applied actions should be invoked and executed. However depending on the content of the collection cells, MPS might generate some default actions which will override your custom actions.</p> <p>Example</p> <p>You have a read only model access cell inside the collection cell:</p> <p></p> <p>In this case the internal MPS generator for <code>CellModel_ReadOnlyModelAccessor</code> will automatically generate and register some default actions like delete/backspace   which in the end will prohibit your custom action to be applied.</p> <p>Solution</p> <p>You can use the  cell explorer (Language Debug \u2192 Show Cell in Explorer) to see which actions are defined for a cell. Deactivate the automatically applied action with the help of custom editor cells(CellModel_CustomFactory). You can use <code>CellModel_CustomFactory</code> to wrap the cells in your collection which generate unwanted actions and deactivate them.</p> <p></p> <p>contributed by: @arimer</p> <p>Can you create a copy-paste handler/paste wrapper for an arbitrary concepts?</p> <p>Yes, the handlers can be created for any concept, e.g. ClassConcept.

I paste a node of concept <code>StatementA</code> into a node of concept<code>StatementB</code> into a role that accepts <code>IStatement</code>. Why is the paste wrapper not called?</p> <p>A paste wrapper only modifies the pasted node if it can change the source concept to the target concept and if the pasted node is not already an instance of the target concept. In the described case, the node of concept <code>StatementA</code> is already an instance of <code>IStatement</code>, that\u2019s why the paste wrapper is not called.</p>","tags":["aspect"]},{"location":"aspects/behavior/","title":"Behavior aspect","text":"<p>The behavior aspect can be use for defining methods for the concepts of the language.</p> <ul> <li>official documentation</li> </ul>","tags":["aspect"]},{"location":"aspects/behavior/#general","title":"General","text":"<p>Can you use asynchronous code in behaviour methods such as calling external tools?</p> <p>Be careful when doing so. Make sure to not mix concurrent locking aspects such as write and read actions with behaviour code.  It should always be assumed that you have the correct lock in this methods. Move the code concerning the concurrent access for example into a background task. More information can be found in Progress indicators | MPS.</p> <p>Where can you save temporary information about nodes?</p> <p>Consider saving temporay data about nodes in annotations and user objects (node/.putUserObject, node/.getUserObject) instead of introducing properties.  You can store and access Java-Objects in <code>SNode::putUserObject()</code> as key-value pairs)where you normally could not access them in the MPS context, e.g. storing it as node member and access it in an editor, a checking-rule or anything else. This approach is difficult to trace and maintain and should only be used in exceptional cases. For the generator consult the section <code>Transferring User Data</code> of the generator documentation.</p> How to mark a constructor-created child optional? (created by a light quotation) <p>Example:</p> <p></p> <p>Solutions:</p> <ul> <li>Initialize it with <code>null</code> in the light quotation.</li> <li>Create it without light quotation.</li> <li>Allow the child to be optional (<code>[0..1]</code>).</li> </ul> <p>How can you delete a child node from a node where the child\u2019s concept no longer exists and the parent node\u2019s child link is no longer defined?</p> <pre><code>node.getChildren().where(\u2026).foreach {it=&gt; it.delete\n}\n</code></pre> Why does the virtual method have isVirtual=false? <p>Given there is a virtual behavior method <code>getPresentation</code>. When I override <code>getPresentation</code> in a subconcept then I see it displays the overriding method to be virtual.</p> <p></p> <p>Yet, I see that <code>methodDeclNode.isVirtual</code> is <code>null</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Why is that?</p> <p>Note that <code>isVirtual</code> and <code>isVirtual()</code> on a method have different semantics.</p> <pre><code>public boolean isVirtual() { return this.isVirtual || this.overridenMethod != null; }\n</code></pre> <p>The editor shows that a method is virtual when <code>isVirtual()</code> is true. As a result, overriding methods of virtual methods are not necessarily having <code>isVirtual=true</code>, but will still display virtual.</p> <p>The rationale behind may be that if a method is overriding another one, both of them must be virtual. This is needed so that the runtime will find out which of the two implementations to call. So we may read the <code>isVirtual</code> more precisely as \u201eis explicitly virtual\u201d, and <code>isVirtual()</code> as \u201cis effectively virtual\u201d.</p> <p>contributed by: @abstraktor</p>","tags":["aspect"]},{"location":"aspects/behavior/#initialization","title":"Initialization","text":"How do you initialize a node? <p>How can I ensure that all created node will have a non-null <code>HTMLDescription</code>?</p> <p>Using a node factory</p> <p>The node factory will be called when</p> <ul> <li>The code completion menu is invoked to create such a node or to replace another one.</li> <li><code>add new initialized</code>, <code>set new initialized</code>, or <code>replace new initialized</code> is called.</li> <li>Such a node is created as a root from the context menu in the project view.</li> </ul> <p>The node factory is not called when</p> <ul> <li>using quotations <code>&lt;Car()&gt;</code>.</li> <li>viewing the node in the editor.</li> <li>adding it as a root with <code>model.add root(&lt;Car()&gt;)</code>.</li> <li>adding it as a root with <code>model.add new root(Car)</code>.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Using a behavior constructor</p> <p>Using a behavior constructor will only partially achieve this.

How can I debug this?</p> <p>The issue behind this kind of issues usually lies in one of these three things:</p> <p>Issue Area 1: Settings (inplace, threading)</p> <p>Try turning off Apply transformations in place in your MPS settings under Build, Execution, Deployment \u2192 Generator \u2192 General, as this is unset in the command line (note, that this setting doesn\u2019t appear in the search):</p> <p></p> <p>Also, disabling the build in parallel threads may help.</p> <p>Issue Area 2: Dependencies</p> <p>A second issue may originate from the separate type of class loading and dependency loading in the command line.</p> <p>Issue Area 3: Generation plans</p> <p>The command line build runs the generator plans that are included in the devkits of a model, or that are explicitly added to the generator facet+tab of a module. If your code starts the build for an explicit generation plan other than that, consider if a different plan could be the culprit. (Remember, right-clicking a model and Show Generation Plan to see if all looks as expected).</p> <p>Remark 1: Inplace transformations are on or off depending on your build script, same applied to parallel generation. On the command line if nothing specified it defaults to 4 threads. The biggest difference is that in the command line build not project is opened, which means anything that tried to access the project including virtual files will fail.</p> <p>Remark 2: One potential source of problems could be packaging of languages and generators. Because in the command line build generators might need to be loaded from packaged jars, any issues with that packaging could affect the generation. For example, as it currently may happen due to MPS-32026 that whole generator models with templates are not loaded and therefore not applied during the generation in the command line.</p> <p>contributed by: @abstraktor</p>","tags":["aspect"]},{"location":"aspects/generator/#blog-posts","title":"Blog posts","text":"<ul> <li>Introduction MPS Generators(F1RE\u2019s blog)</li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>MPS forum - I want to export multiple languages from MPS \u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>MPS forum - Is it possible to export a DSL compiler created with MPS and use it independently \u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>MPS forum - Generator error: uncaught exception ?no classifier? \u21a9</p> </li> </ol>","tags":["aspect"]},{"location":"aspects/intentions/","title":"Intentions aspect","text":"<p>Intentions provide fast access to the most used operations with syntactical constructions of a language.</p> <p>\u2014 MPS documentation</p> <ul> <li>official documentation</li> </ul> <p>How can you go to the declaration of an intention when you open the intention menu?</p> <p>Select the intention and click the arrow/press right arrow key \u2192 Go to intention declaration.</p> <p>How do you execute an action as an intention?</p> <p>Add the action to the action group ActionsAsIntentions.</p> How can you group intentions and give them names? <p>Use com.mbeddr.mpsutil.intentions from  MPS-extensions.

My test case has a check node called data and my test case has a a test test1 which prints the node ID of data My test case has a a test test2 which prints the node id of data. When I run the test test1 and test2 print different node IDs.</p> <p>Why is that?</p> <p></p> <p>Terms used:</p> <ul> <li>check-node for these fixture nodes that you enter into the test case under nodes</li> <li>test case for the root node, the chunk that contains the tests</li> <li>tests for the test methods of which we have test1 and test2</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Each test case runs on its own copy of its model. </li> </ul> <p>MPS tries to keep tests reproducible and isolated even when being run in-process. For that, MPS copies the whole model into a temporary model. Modifications of one test case will then be invisible to the next test case, since it will work on a new temporary model. This prevents test-cases from interacting.</p> <p>Running tests in a separate model ensures that they will never modify the original model (as long as you don\u2019t explicitly start acting on other models).</p> <ul> <li>Check-nodes per test</li> </ul> <p>A test-case may have multiple tests though. MPS also isolates single tests within the same test case. For that, the check-nodes are copied once for each test. Each test may then act on their own copy.</p> <pre><code>// there is one data node in the model for each test\nassert 2 equals data.model.nodes(Data).size\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>All tests of a test-case share their referenced nodes</li> </ul> <p>To save memory though, these check-nodes all lie in the same model for each test case. References to other nodes outside the test case will only need to be copied once and be shared by all tests of that test case. As a result, the IDs of check-nodes change and the IDs of non-check-nodes are the same as in the original model.</p> <pre><code>// nodes in this model that are not check-nodes of this test case will only be there once\nassert 1 equals dataRef.model.nodes(Chunk).size;\n</code></pre> <p>Consequently, multiple tests of the same test case are not fully isolated. In the following example, both tests assert and do the same, yet test3 passes while test4 fails. The data element is now located in a separate chunk outside the testcase and the check-node is a reference to it. As a result, test4 is running red because test3 already modified the referenced node.</p> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>Kinds of tests</p> </li> <li> <p>I checked this behavior in-depth for node tests.</p> </li> <li>I think it is similar for editor tests.</li> <li>I am sure that this does not apply to baseLang-tests since they don\u2019t prepare a temporary model for you.</li> </ul> <p>Practical effects of this</p> <p>These are some rules of thumb that result from that:</p> <ul> <li>The tests of a test-case may interact, so you should inline all modified nodes into the testcase to be check-nodes.</li> <li>Whenever you modify many nodes in the model, consider writing a migration and migration test instead.</li> <li>Remember that the console and each test will output separate IDs for the conceptually same node.

If you don\u2019t override any methods of it, it will suppress all constraint, typesystem and cardinality errors and warnings.</p> <ul> <li>You may override <code>#suppress(node&lt;&gt;)</code> to only suppress the errors of certain subnodes.</li> <li> <p>You may override <code>#suppress(NodeReportItem)</code> to only suppress certain errors.

The generator of the build language has to find out what, for example, \u201csolution needs baselanguage\u201d means at runtime-level. To execute code from the solution, the JVM needs the baselanguage.jar on the classpath. The more dependencies the solution has, the more complex becomes the generated ant file, because the generator has to consider all these transitive dependencies. The generator needs to know what artefact a module generates and how the generated artefact/module is used at runtime. Therefore, the jars must be on the classpath.</p> <p>The modules in the mps-groups in the MPS build script contain information from the serialized descriptors (.msd files, .mpl files, \u2026). The Reload all modules from disk intention loads them explicitly. The descriptor files aren\u2019t read before generation, so that you should always verify before you push if your MPS build scripts are up-to-date. For every dependency added to a module or a changed reexport flag, this intention has to be triggered by hand.</p> <p>Problem: the current implementation of the build-language isn\u2019t extensible, because it always looks into the original model. The main part of the ant file generation is the dependency analysis (for the modules), and for this it needs to access the original model for some technical reasons. These limit you to languages which are provided by MPS. You can\u2019t use your own patterns, for example, you can\u2019t write an extension which picks all modules from a folder, generates an intellij-plugin out of them and stores the result in a zip file and generates all the code required for the command-line build. But this isn\u2019t possible because of the build-language-inherent dependency analysis mechanism.</p> <p>The code generator of the build language has to verify for dependencies like jars in stub-models, jars at runtime etc., but the error messages aren\u2019t well-designed. For example, you have a jar file xyz.jar entered as java runtime dependency of the language abc. Instead of something like \u201cyou have to enter xyz.jar to your build layout plugin-123, cause language abc specifies it as java runtime dependency\u201d you get for example \u201cjar stub library should be extracted into build-script: <code>${my.project}/very/long/path/lib/xyz.jar</code>\u201c\u201a which isn\u2019t helpful.</p> <p>Many problems the generator finds could also be found by the model checker, but the checks are done at generation time and implemented as \u201cgencontext.show error\u201d in the generator.</p>","tags":["mps_language","build"]},{"location":"build/#generated-ant-scripts-buildxml","title":"Generated ant scripts (build.xml)","text":"<p>The mps build scripts are generated to ant scripts, which then generate the modules. The ant script starts a headless-MPS with all required dependencies, puts jars on the classpath and does some further magic. Tasks can be passed to the ant script like the \u201cgenerate\u201d task.</p> <p>Modules have several models with dependencies. For example, for a language, the behavior uses the structure aspect; the type-system uses the behavior aspect etc. which can result in complex dependencies between these models. These have to be considered when the models are generated and compiled. The order is derived by the code generator of the build language and results in an execution plan where the \u201ccompile units\u201d are grouped in \u201cchunks\u201d. Chunks with bootstrap-dependencies are explicitly marked, which means all modules in the chunk have to be compiled at the same time.</p> <p>MPS consists of hundreds of jar files which must be on the classpath for the code generation and compilation, which leads to giant ant scripts (with some thousand lines). Even simple mps build scripts, which only use BaseLanguage result into big ant scripts.</p> <p>The build layout in the MPS build script defines how your modules are packaged e.g. as zip containing multiple plugins, as simple plugin-folder, as lib-folder with a flat list of jars, etc.</p> <p>The ant script needs to know where the local MPS is installed and where your modules and dependencies are located. This is usually done using folder macros in the mps build script which are generated as \u201cproperties\u201d in the Ant script. This makes the build independent of your local machine and the ant script can be executed on the CI or any other machine.</p> <p>The Headless-MPS, which is started by the ant script, behaves sometimes differently compared to an IDE-MPS. For example, circular dependencies can be resolved in the IDE by just applying Make Project multiple times, which doesn\u2019t work on the command line and thus also fails on the CI. Dependencies which are visible in the IDE aren\u2019t always visible in the MPS build script/ ant script and can result in failing builds. MPS holds one big global repository, where all modules are loaded into the modules pool (project libraries, global libraries, \u2026). In the IDE everything\u2019s always visible and wrong dependencies can be resolved but on the command line the build can fail, because the referenced model isn\u2019t loaded. The build language generator doesn\u2019t check the nodes for e.g. references out of scope (like the model-checker does), it only looks into meta-data/model-properties and relies on that information.</p>","tags":["mps_language","build"]},{"location":"build/#shell-scripts","title":"Shell scripts","text":"<p>Some scripts like the start script of MPS are developed using Windows Batch Scripting on Windows and Bash Shell Scripting on Mac/Linux.

Kotlin provides type-checking and the auto-completion works better compared to groovy (with Intellij); this makes it easier to use with complex scripts.</p>","tags":["infrastructure"]},{"location":"build/gradle/#dependencies","title":"Dependencies","text":"","tags":["infrastructure"]},{"location":"build/gradle/#dependencies-inside-the-buildscript-block","title":"Dependencies inside the buildScript{\u2026} block","text":"<ul> <li>are placed on the classpath of the build script itself (for the current gradle file which will also be compiled (like java))</li> <li>To be able to compile the build script into bytecode, its dependencies need to be resolved</li> </ul>","tags":["infrastructure"]},{"location":"build/gradle/#dependencies-outside-the-buildscript-block","title":"Dependencies outside the buildScript{\u2026} block","text":"<ul> <li>are project dependencies</li> <li>these dependencies are added to the project code\u2019s classpath</li> <li>example: Gson is used inside a gradle project and needs to be on the classpath of the project to be able to compile the project.</li> </ul> <p>If the dependency in only used in the buildscript (i.e. only from the <code>build.gradle</code> file) then it should be in a <code>buildscript { }</code> block.

Given a repository, references to modules/models/nodes can be resolved. There\u2019s no need in making ids unique globally as each subsystem knows, which exact repository it needs to use at any moment. (e.g. the type-system knows where it stores its type-nodes, so it will not try to resolve references to them )</p> <p>A repository contains modules, modules have model roots, each model root can load models. Also a module can be a models container itself (without model root). A model is then a set of root nodes. Each root node is a root of a tree of nodes, So that overall, a repository is a tree structure.</p> <p> </p> <p>Is there an existing expression/scripting language?</p> <p>There is the expressions sample project.

(open a context menu where baselanguage code is allowed and search for classes / concepts from the same language)<ul> <li> \u2192 Use Edit \u2192 Add Language Import to import the language containing the concept / the intention.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Check the concept: is the type of the concept suitable for the place where you want to create an instance? Does it implement the right interface?</li> <li>Check the intention: is the <code>isApplicable()</code>-method called? (add a <code>System.err.println()</code> to the method and check what MPS outputs)<ul> <li> \u2192 The intention is most probably not visible in the model \u2192 see above</li> <li> \u2192 Make sure the method returns true</li> </ul> </li> <li>Concept: does a constraint on one of the ancestor-nodes prohibit you from creating it?</li> </ol> <p>MPS build fails.</p> <ol> <li>Does the MPS Model-Checker report problems?  \u2192 Fix identified problems.</li> <li>Does the build log report intelligible problems?  \u2192 Fix identified problems.</li> <li>Does it build in Gradle?  \u2192 See: Gradle-Build fails.</li> </ol> <p>MPS can\u2019t be started at all.</p> <p>There could be multiple reasons:</p> <ul> <li>One reason could be a wrong Java version. That could be a different Java runtime like the GraalVM or an incorrect Java version.   MPS 2022.2 and newer need JDK 17, older ones need JDK 11 and ancient versions of MPS need JDK 8.</li> <li>Through external changes, files of an MPS project could get deleted or corrupted by accident (such as deleting model files). There should be an   exception that show give a hint why the startup fails. The log file should also contain an error message.</li> </ul> <p>Basic MPS functionality stops working (e.g. typing doesn\u2019t work, the editor has in incorrect layout, the window turns blank).</p> <p>If you are not using one of the platforms, you probably should report the issue to the MPS issue tracker. Most of the bugs are caused by languages or plugins in  MPS-extensions/ mbeddr platform.</p> <p>For editor related issue first try pressing F5 and check if the relayout of the editor fixes the editor. If it does, report an issue in  MPS-extensions.   The most likely culprit is the celllayout language.   If another basic editor functionality like typing doesn\u2019t work anymore, the same language or another language in the same repository can cause such issues.   For all other issues, check if a fatal error was thrown in the lower right corner.</p> <p>Visit the issue tracker reference page to find the right issue tracker   when you can\u2019t identify the repository based on the package name in the error message. Please don\u2019t just report the issue to the   JetBrains MPS issue tracker because the issue will likely be marked as invalid and   doesn\u2019t land in the right issue tracker.</p>","tags":["troubleshooting","settings"]},{"location":"home/trouble_shooting_guide/#gradle","title":"Gradle","text":"<p>Gradle build fails.</p> <ol> <li>Did you call <code>git clean -fxd -e build.properties</code> before <code>./gradlew</code>?  \u2192 Do it, retry.</li> <li>Did you call <code>./gradlew</code> with <code>--refresh-dependencies</code>?  \u2192 Retry with <code>--refresh-dependencies</code>.</li> <li>Does the error message start with \u201cdependencies should be extracted into build script\u201d?<ul> <li>In MPS, apply the model-checker to the \u201c_build\u201d-package.

Hence, for integrating your changes into master you would end up with a merge:</p> <pre><code>* 3c36424        (HEAD -&gt; master) fixed some super important issue\n| * 66beba4      (feature/my-awesome-stuff) more work on my awesome feature\n| * cca995e      did some stuff\n|/\n* 1ed51e3        added another file\n* 5cee848        initial commit\n</code></pre> <p>To get your commits into master, first make sure that your local history is up-to-date by running <code>git fetch</code>. Next, rebase your commits. This prevents a merge from happening. This is achieved with the following git command on our branch: <code>git rebase -i origin/master</code>. Git will now ask you how to proceed with your commits: <pre><code>pick cca995e did some stuff\npick 66beba4 more work on my awesome feature\n</code></pre></p> <p>Now squash all commits into a single commit while rebasing:</p> <pre><code>pick cca995e did some stuff\nsquash 66beba4 more work on my awesome feature\n</code></pre> <p>Afterward, Git asks you to enter a message for the new commit. The default message it offers is a concatenation of all the commit messages from the commits to squash. However, you want to make the new commit message fit the earlier described pattern.</p> <p>After rebasing your Git history looks like this: <pre><code>* afc0fb5        (HEAD -&gt; feature/my-awesome-stuff)  42: super awesome feature\n* 3c36424        (master) fixed some super important issue\n* 1ed51e3        added another file\n* 5cee848        initial commit\n</code></pre></p> <p>You still have to branch; now it\u2019s time to merge them. Change your git branch to master using <code>git checkout origin/master</code>. Make sure you have pulled from the remote and your branch is up-to-date. Now run <code>git merge --ff-only feature/my-awesome-stuff</code>. The \u2013ff-only is important to force git to not merge if it would produce a merge commit.</p> <p>Now Git history looks like this:</p> <pre><code>* afc0fb5        (HEAD -&gt; master, feature/my-awesome-stuff)  42: super awesome feature\n* 3c36424        fixed some super important issue\n* 1ed51e3        added another file\n* 5cee848        initial commit\n</code></pre> <p>You haven\u2019t created a merge commit, and all commits from your branch appear as a single commit in the Git history. You are good to go to push back to the repo. But wait, what if somebody has changes things in the meantime on the remote, wouldn\u2019t the pull create a new merge? Yes it would! Therefor don\u2019t use a plain <code>git pull</code> but use <code>git pull --rebase</code> for when you are pulling from the repo into your local master branch.

When I download the MPS source, open the project in MPS under <code>code</code> and open <code>j.m.l.editor/SubstituteMenuPart_ReferenceScope_declare</code>, then I see the model being read-only. What can I do?</p> <p>You need to open MPS in IDEA (Community Edition is enough), compile and run it from there, then you can edit MPS sources. There are instructions in README.</p> How can you do a fulltext search in the IDE? <p>I sometimes need a textual search which MPS doesn\u2019t provide out of the box.</p> <p>In that situation, I am unsure of the concept and type of what I see, so a top-down search is not an option. Instead I would like to search for that string to have a starting point for my investigation.</p> <p>Examples:</p> <ul> <li>I want to investigate in an editor in the user interface and don\u2019t want to reverse engineer what hints, editors and concepts lead to what I see.</li> <li>Behavioral view code, like custom cells, swing cells or querylists make it hard to figure out where the source logic of that is located.</li> <li>when the console shows something I don\u2019t understand, I\u2019d like to see its context source code, so that I can figure out what to do next.</li> </ul> <p>Option 0: Use Language Debugging facilities of MPS instead.</p> <p>For built-in languages, MPS brings a load of dedicated debugging facilities:</p> <ul> <li>Debugging editor cells and nodes: When you right-click an item in the editor, you can find a submenu Language Debug.</li> <li>Debugging menu entries: Select an item that you\u2019re curious in and press Cmd+Alt+B/Ctrl+Alt+B to open the Menu Trace of it.</li> <li>Setup and an IntelliJ and connect it to step through java code.</li> </ul> <p>Option 1: Search for literals from console.</p> <p>Option 2: Search through serialized Java.</p> <ol> <li>Set up IntelliJ with your project.</li> <li>Hit Cmd+Shift+F/Ctrl+Shift+F to search in path.</li> <li>When you found a class of interest, open it in MPS via Cmd+N/Ctrl+N. The source node usually has a similar name.</li> </ol> <p>This is great for finding editor nodes, for example, if that java class is named Vehicle_EditorBuilder, your source node was an editor for the Vehicle concept.</p> <p>Last Resort: Search XML model directly.</p> <p>Use this only if you have no assembly and your project doesn\u2019t open. The serialized API is subject to change and using this should be the last barrier.</p> <p>Then use ack (or a similar tool) on the command line to find the relevant models that contain this string. The output even contains the node id though, as in this example:</p> <pre><code>$ ack \"ack com.mbeddr.mpsutil.grammarcells\"\n\u2026\n&lt;node concept=\"3bR9La\" id=\"1aL6sVX49Cb\" role=\"1SiIV1\"&gt;\n    &lt;property role=\"3bR36h\" value=\"false\" /&gt;\n    &lt;ref role=\"3bR37D\" to=\"90a9:F1NWDqq_DA\" resolve=\"com.mbeddr.mpsutil.grammarcells.runtime\" /&gt;\n&lt;/node&gt;\n\u2026\n</code></pre> <p>Use <code>new IdEncoder().parseNodeId(\"1aL6sVX49Cb\")</code> to get the node id. This will print the corresponding node to console. Clicking it will open in in MPS:</p> <pre><code>#nodes.where({~it =&gt; boolean equals = false; try { equals = it/.getNodeId().equals(new IdEncoder().parseNodeId(\"1aL6sVX49Cb\")); } catch (Exception e) { &lt;no statements&gt; } return equals; })\n</code></pre> How to get rid of Error: shall specify a repository to lock? <p>When accessing model properties in rendering code, you must encapsulate the model accessing code in a read action:</p> <p></p> <p>It always has an error \u201cError: shall specify a repository to lock\u201d. How can I get rid of it? What is a \u2018repository\u2019 and is there any documentation that explains the concept and how to use it correctly?</p> <p>asked by: @cwalesch</p> <p>The repository is what is represented as the \u201cmodules pool\u201d in the UI. It contains all the dependencies currently visible. At the moment there is only one global repository which causes several problems. MPS is slowly but steadily moving to project specific repositories. That would mean each project (window) of MPS would have it\u2019s own separate repository. </p> <p>To get the repository you will need access to the project. e.g. the editor context will give you access to the repository: <code>editorContext.getRepository()</code>.</p> <p>In other cases, for instance,  when you don\u2019t have an editor context directly available you need to make sure that from UI (action) you pass the project or repository though to the place where you need it.</p> <p>answered by: @coolya</p> How can you get an identifier of a node? <p>Given I have a node myNode and I need to serialize something that identifies it. When I serialize that something and then deserialize that identifier again, then I will find exactly that node. How can I build such a thing?</p> <p>Option 1: PersistenceFacade ID</p> <p>Since the url does not look nice; you may use this combined string of model ID and node ID that is used for the url. For that, import the class <code>org.jetbrains.mps.openapi.persistence.PersistenceFacade</code> from the MPS.OpenApi stub and run:</p> <pre><code># serialize identifier\nstring mySerializedId = SNodePointer.serialize(node/.getReference())\n# find node based on serialized identifier\nnode&lt;&gt; myFoundNode = SNodePointer.deserialize(mySerializedId).resolve(repository)\n# then, node == myFoundNode\n</code></pre> <p>Option 2: Url</p> <p>Import the <code>httpsupport</code> language and use <code>node.getURL</code>. This will be a url that you can use locally to open this node. It includes the node id and the model and thus is a pretty good globally unique id.</p> <p>This id is a local URL and looks odd though: <code>http://127.0.0.1:63320/node?ref=r%3A4bc03cd1-b1e3-49da-84da-f27e7062f6f7%28integrityOfUpdate%29%2F2209769512593382448&amp;project=SecurityAnalyst</code>. Especially the code to find the node again based on this url contains some grepping then.</p> <p>Option 3: Node Id</p> <p>Use <code>node/.getNodeId().toString()</code> it will yield the nodes id. Note that a node ID is only unique within this model. If it should be globally unique, consider option 1.</p> <p>contributed by: @abstraktor</p> Where does MPS store preferences? <p>For a starting point, read Directories used by the IDE.

Loading a class into an MPS module involves the module class loader, the class of its dependencies and the bootstrap-class-loader. If a class comes from a jar in the MPS/lib folder (a bootstrap-loaded class), you practically can\u2019t load another version of it. They also have different life cycles.</p> <p>Module class loaders can reload classes after rebuilding and are resilient towards hot reloading. IDEA plugin class loaders are just for the installed plugins and didn\u2019t know what to do if a class needs reloading during runtime in the past. New versions of the intelliJ platform know how to reload classes, but now we\u2019re with MPS\u2019 implementation. The IDEA plugin classloaders load jars from the /plugins//lib directory. Jars from the /lib directory of the RCP are loaded from the root class loader. For your RCP, you usually don\u2019t want to put anything there.

Although it was introduced in IntelliJ IDEA 2020.1 it might not work in older MPS versions because of classloading issues. The browser itself (<code>JBCefBrowser</code>) can be embedded in the MPS editor with a swing component cell. For simple use cases, it is enough to call <code>browser.loadHTML</code> to load some HTMl code. The code can be created by Java or by calling the MPS generator or TextGen.</p> <p>Existing Java documentation and examples on the web:</p> <ul> <li>Java JCEF example that showcases all kinds of handlers and dialogs</li> <li>IntelliJ Markdown preview</li> <li>How do I use JCEF with Intellij?</li> <li>CEF documentation (non Java version)</li> </ul> <p>The third link contains an answer on how to do bidirectional communication between the embedded browser and Java (MPS): You have to create a browser pipe between Java (implementation) and JS (implementation). The communication is done through JS. You then have a <code>subscribe</code> method that you can use to listening to events posted through a specific tag or create an event using the <code>post</code> method. These methods are available in Java and JS.</p> <p>Warning: MPS and the IntelliJ IDEA use Swing to create all the UI components. They are considered lightweight because they  are drawn by Java itself. JCEF uses native code, it is a heavyweight component. Especially with MPS\u2018 reloading capabilities, it is important to correctly dispose the browser when it isn\u2019t needed anymore.

list.</p> Texts are readable. <p>The contrast ratio between the background color and the foreground text color should be at least 4.5:1 article. Contrast checkers can also help you. Here are some colors with a high contrast:</p> <p></p> <p>When using a gray scale color, make sure that the text color doesn\u2019t exceed 48% brightness (source). Make also sure to provide different colors for different color schemes (e.g. darcula theme vs light theme).</p> <p>Bad example #1</p> <p></p> <p>Bad example #2</p> <p></p> Bold and underline aren\u2019t used together. <p>This is an anti-pattern.

Buttons can alse be used as up and down keys. Buttons can also be hidden to not disrupt the text editing: </p> <p>Add option to hide buttons (checkbox, editor hint, action, etc.).</p> Clickable elements appear clickable. <p>When elements are clickable, they should appear clickable: They should use an indicator or different style (e.g. underlines and blue or styled like a button).</p> You align collections when possible. <p>Alignment is an important aspect in design (introduction). Use vertical grids instead of vertical collections to align cells nicely. It is also very important for readability.</p> You use color for emphasis and to convey information. <p>Not only bold font can be used to emphasize words but also color. Make sure that the used color is correctly associated by the user.</p> <p>Bad example</p> <p>Greyscale editor + grey is associated with disabled content/meta information such as comments. </p> <p>Good example</p> <p></p> <p>Color is used to distinguish different language features: BLUE for numbers, lila/green for CONSTANTS.</p> You use labels in a consistent way. <p>Labels should be used consistently in the design (e.g. always bold, colon after label), the same goes for key value pairs. There is no best practise for the separation between label and text. Some ideas and common guidelines can be found here.</p> <p></p> The context of UI elements is consistent. <p>Counterexample: There are 3 buttons next to each other that look similar: One opens an external documentation, the other navigates to a root node and the third one undos a change. This could be confusing and frustrating for the user.</p> A default empty statement exists. <p>There should always be a default concept that acts as an empty line or empty text. It should be editable and support autocompletion. They should have an indicator that they are editable. The easist way is to provide a placeholder value.</p> <p>Bad example</p> <p></p> Different groups are distinguishable from each other. <p>Groups can be separated for example by whitespace, by drawing a border (box) or drawing brackets around the content.</p> You emphasize non-standard operations/literals. <p>Emphasize special operations or literals to make it clear that they are not. Another good examples in baselanguage are extension methods.</p> <p></p> Enough paddings surround elements. <p>Make sure there is enough space between the content and its border (padding) otherwhise the editor looks too packed. More information from a design perspective can be found here.</p> You use existing stylesheets. <p>For baselanguage there is BaseLanguageStyle. You can search globally for instances of Stylesheet to find more styles.</p> The font size conveys hierarchy. <p>More information can be found in this beginner\u2019s guide to typographic hierarchy.</p> <p>Example hierarchy (source: Font Size And Weight Matters) : </p> You use the full window with for your editor. <p>Often times the space in editor components is not good used and a lot of space is left empty on the right side of the window.  This can be improved by using multiple groups next to each other or using the right hand side of the screen for some sort of legend for graphics or meta information about the (root) node (e.g. code review).</p> Headers follow general UI principles. <p>The following principles should be followed:</p> <ul> <li>hierarchical relationship of ideas</li> <li>consistency</li> <li>readability</li> <li>specificity</li> </ul> <p>More information can be found in Technical writing essentials - Headings.</p> Headers are distinguishable from content. <p>Bad example</p> <p></p> <p>The header and the start of the child concepts use bold font and the same text. In this example the text \u201cOutput\u201d is redundant. The header should be larger in size.</p> <p>A common layout is header-input-output: At the top is the header, then there are the inputs/declarations, followed by the output/body. Make sure to separated this three groups in some ways (such as horizontal lines or empty lines).</p> <p>Mixed example</p> <p></p> Lines aren\u2019t too thick and not textual. <p>A good maximum width for borders and other lines is 3 pixels. This is just a rough guideline but with thicker lines the design becomes overwhelming.</p> <p>Bad example</p> <p></p> You don\u2019t emphasize meta/not important information. <p>Good example</p> <p></p> <p>A smaller font, light gray color or maybe a different font seems to work well. Inherited value can also be shown this way: display them as placeholder values in a light gray color. Don\u2019t emphasize comments by making them bold or stand out in any way.</p> <p>Bad example</p> <p></p> The reflective editor is never shown. <p>The reflective editor provides a default editor for nodes. The editor is only readonly and should only be used for debugging purposes.</p> <p>Bad example</p> <p></p> You use The right form of projection for the task in the editor. <p>The right projections are used (text, tables, diagrams..) and different kind of projections are provided when necessary (switchable by menu or editor hints).</p> <p>Example: multiple projections</p> <p></p> You didn\u2019t forget to enable anti aliasing for custom swing components. <p>When you create a custom component and have a paint-Method, call EditorComponent.turnOnAliasingIfPossible to enable anti aliasing. More information can be found in the Java documentation.</p> All usages of symbols are clear. <p>When using symbols, make sure that the user understands what it means.  A Plus symbol might be easy to understand (add, increase), a complex shape that is not usuable used might be not. Common icons can be found for example in the fontawesome icon pack.</p> You abbreviate often used words and symbol. <p>Abbreviate words that are often used in the editor or use symbols. Examples:</p> <ul> <li>The Letter \u201cm\u201d or a red star * is often used to mark a field as mandatory.</li> <li>The plus sign \u2295 is used to indicate an \u201cadd\u201d action.</li> </ul>","tags":["best_practise","ui"]},{"location":"patterns/user_experience/","title":"User experience and user interfaces","text":"","tags":["best_practise","ui"]},{"location":"patterns/user_experience/#basics","title":"Basics","text":"<ul> <li>7 Graphic Design Principles to Up-Level your Graphics</li> <li>7 Gestalt Principles of Design</li> <li>10 Graphic Design Rules You Should Never Break</li> <li>20 Most Important UI Design Principles for UI Designer</li> <li>What are the basic rules of user interface design?

Understand your users\u2019 needs through goal, scenario, and task analysis. Determine a set of features that realizes these objectives.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove unnecessary elements. Remove elements that aren\u2019t likely to be used or have preferable alternatives.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove unnecessary redundancy. There might be several effective ways to perform a task. To achieve simplicity, make the hard decision and choose the best one for your target users instead of providing all of them and making the choice an option.</p> </li> <li> <p>Make it \u201cjust work\u201d automatically. The element is necessary, but any user interaction to get it to work is not because an acceptable default behavior or configuration exists. To achieve simplicity, make it work automatically and either hide it from the user completely or reduce its exposure significantly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Combine what should be combined. Put the essential features that support a task together so that a task can be performed in one place. The task\u2019s steps should have a unified, streamlined flow. Break down complex tasks into a set of easy, clear steps, so that \u201cone\u201d place might consist of several UI surfaces, such as a wizard.</p> </li> <li> <p>Separate what should be separated. Not everything can be presented in one place, so always have clear, well-chosen boundaries. Make features that support core scenarios central and obvious, and hide optional functionality or make it peripheral. Separate individual tasks and provide links to related tasks. For example, tasks related to manipulating photos should be separated from tasks related to managing collections of photos, but they should be readily accessible from each other.</p> </li> <li> <p>Eliminate what can be eliminated. Take a printout of your design and highlight the elements used to perform the most important tasks. Even highlight the individual words in the UI text that communicate useful information. Now review what isn\u2019t highlighted and consider removing it from the design. If you remove the item, would anything bad happen? If not, remove it!   Consistency, configurability, and generalization are often desirable qualities, but they can lead to unnecessary complexity. Review your design for misguided efforts in consistency (such as having redundant text), generalization (such as having any several time zones when two is enough), and configurability (such as options that users aren\u2019t likely to change), and eliminate what can be eliminated.</p> </li> <li> <p>Put the elements in the right place. Within a window, an element\u2019s location should follow its utility. Essential controls, instructions, and explanations should all be in context in logical order. If more options are needed, expose them in context by clicking a chevron or similar mechanism; if more information is needed, display an info-tip on mouse hover. Place less important tasks, options, and Help information outside the main flow in a separate window or page. The technique of displaying additional detail as needed is called progressive disclosure.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use meaningful high-level combinations. It is often simpler and more scalable to select and manipulate groups of related elements than individual elements. Examples of high-level combinations include folders, themes, styles, and user groups. Such combinations often map to a user goal or intention that isn\u2019t apparent from the individual elements. For example, the intention behind the High Contrast Black color scheme is far more apparent than that of a black window background.</p> </li> <li> <p>Select the right controls. Design elements are embodied by the controls you use to represent them, so selecting the right control is crucial to efficient presentation. For example, the font selection box used by Microsoft Word shows both a preview of the font and also the most recently used fonts. Similarly, the way Word shows potential spelling and grammar errors in place is much simpler than the dialog box alternative.</p> </li> <li> <p>Make tasks discoverable and visible. All tasks, but especially frequent tasks, should be readily discoverable within the user interface. The steps required to perform tasks should be visible and should not rely on memorization.</p> </li> <li> <p>Present tasks in the user\u2019s domain. Complex software requires users to map their problems to the technology. Simple software does that mapping for them by presenting what is natural. For example, a red-eye reduction feature maps directly to the problem space and doesn\u2019t require users to think in terms of details like hues and gradients.</p> </li> <li> <p>Put domain knowledge into the program. Users shouldn\u2019t be required to access external information to use your application successfully. Domain knowledge can range from complex data and algorithms to simply making it clear what type of input is valid.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use text that users understand. Well-crafted text is crucial to effective communication with users. Use concepts and terms familiar to your users. Fully explain what is being asked in plain language so that users can make intelligent, informed decisions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use safe, secure, probable defaults. If a setting has a value that applies to most users in most circumstances, and that setting is both safe and secure, use it as the default value. Make users specify values only when necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use constraints. If many ways to perform a task exist, but only some are correct, constrain the task to those correct ways. Users should not be allowed to make readily preventable mistakes.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Window UX Top Violations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use ordinary, conversational terms when you can. Focus on the user goals, not technology. This is especially effective if you are explaining a complex technical concept or action. Imagine yourself looking over the user\u2019s shoulder and explaining how to do the task. IN CONFLICT WITH Domain</p> </li> <li> <p>Be polite, supportive, and encouraging. The user should never feel condescended to, blamed, or intimidated.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove redundant text. Look for redundant text in window titles, main instructions, supplemental instructions, content areas, command links, and commit buttons. Generally, leave full text in main instructions and interactive controls, and remove any redundancy from the other places.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use title-style capitalization for titles, and sentence-style capitalization for all other UI elements.</p> </li> <li> <p>For feature and technology names, be conservative in capitalizing. Typically, only major components should be capitalized (using title-style capitalization).</p> </li> <li> <p>For feature and technology names, be consistent in capitalizing. If the name appears more than once on a UI screen, it should always appear the same way. Likewise, across all UI screens in the program, the name should be consistently presented.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don\u2019t capitalize the names of generic user interface elements, such as toolbar, menu, scroll bar, button, and icon. Exceptions: Address bar, Links bar, ribbon.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don\u2019t use blue text that isn\u2019t a link, because users may assume that it is a link. Use bold or a shade of gray where you\u2019d otherwise use colored text.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use bold sparingly to draw attention to text users must read.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don\u2019t place periods at the end of control labels or main instructions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use one space between sentences. Not two.</p> </li> <li> <p>Label every control or group of control</p> </li> <li> <p>For all controls, select the safest (to prevent loss of data or system access), most secure value by default. If safety and security aren\u2019t factors, select the most likely or convenient value.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use notifications for events that are unrelated to the current user activity, don\u2019t require immediate user action, and users can freely ignore.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don\u2019t abuse notifications: Use notifications only if you need to. When you display a notification, you are potentially interrupting users or even annoying them. Make sure that interruption is justified. Use notifications for non-critical events or situations that don\u2019t require immediate user action. For critical events or situations that require immediate user action, use an alternative UI element (such as a modal dialog box). Don\u2019t use notifications for feature advertisements!</p> </li> <li> <p>Never require users to click an object to determine if it is clickable. Users must be able to determine the clickability by visual inspection alone.</p> </li> <li> <p>Whenever possible, propose a solution so users can fix the problem. However, make sure the proposed solution is likely to solve the problem. Don\u2019t waste users\u2019 time by suggesting possible, but improbable, solutions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Be specific. Avoid vague wording, such as syntax error and illegal operation. Provide specific names, locations, and values of the objects involved.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don\u2019t use phrasing that blames the user or implies user error. Avoid using you and your in the phrasing. While the active voice is generally preferred, use the passive voice when the user is the subject and might feel blamed for the error if the active voice were used.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don\u2019t use OK for error messages. Users don\u2019t view errors as being OK. If the error message has no direct action, use Close instead.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don\u2019t use the following words: Error, failure (use problem instead) Failed to (use unable to instead) Illegal, invalid, bad (use incorrect or not valid instead) Abort, kill, terminate (use stop instead) Catastrophic, fatal (use serious instead)</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["best_practise","ui"]},{"location":"patterns/user_experience/#dark-theme","title":"Dark theme","text":"<p>Use the predefined colors in MPS or define your own colors using the class JBColor with the constructor <code>JBColor(light theme color, dark theme color)</code>.

It doesn\u2019t use all the plugins but rather extends it through the IntelliJ platform SDK to add support for tools that can be used to design domain-specific languages. The Projectional editor of MPS is a custom editor implementation instead of the standard text editor therefore many text-based features of IntelliJ won\u2019t work (such as syntax language injections or code templates). Some features are unused or disabled such as the Program Structure Interface which is normally used as the layer responsible for parsing files and creating the syntactic and semantic code model.</p> <p>MPS/IntelliJ IDEA requires a Java Runtime. Both use the JetBrains Runtime, a fork of OpenJDK. It includes several enhancements in font rendering, ligatures, HiDPI support, windowing/focus subsystems, performance improvements, and bug fixes. The repository mbeddr/build.publish.jdk publishes the needed runtimes for the different MPS versions on the itemis nexus server.</p> <p>A zipped version of all MPS versions as well as the most import components of MPS (jar files) such as the editor API or the model checker are also published through the repository mbeddr/build.publish.mps to the itemis nexus server.</p> <p>Custom RCP version of MPS can be created which are customized versions of MPS. The first big RCP was mbeddr with its repository located at mbeddr/mbeddr.core. The old homepage is located at mbeddr/mbeddr.github.io. Useful plugins were extracted into the subproject com.mbeddr.mpsutil with its old documentation hosted at mbeddr.com/platform.html. Some plugins and languages where later moved to a new repository JetBrains/MPS-extensions, especially the editor-related languages. The repository is hosted by JetBrains. A list of all extensions in this repository can be found here. Many extensions were contributed by itemis, a few of them by DSLFoundry. The documentation for both platforms is hosted on GitHub and on the current website respectively. Mbeddr.core has a dependency on MPS-Extensions.</p> <p>The mbeddr organization also hosts mbeddr.formal: FASTEN (FormAl SpecificaTion ENvironment) which is a set of DSLs to experiment with rigorous systems and safety engineering and mps-qa which is a quality assurance tooling for MPS (blog post).</p> <p>A further platform that builds on the other two is IETS3/iets3.opensource which mostly consists of KernelF, an extensible and functional language that can be used in MPS as the core language of DSls and can be generated into Java code.</p> <p>To build MPS projects, the MPS build language is used which generates Ant scripts that can be executed on the command line. The Ant scripts can be called directly. Other projects use Maven instead. The most popular build automation tool is Gradle. Mbeddr/mps-gradle-plugin is a Gradle plugin that helps build MPS-based projects with Gradle. This plugin is used by all MPS platforms as well as many other MPS projects. It also contains a task download-jbr which can use the JBR artifacts that were published by the build.publish.mps repository. Some plugins were extracted into the repository mbeddr/mps-build-backends which allows executing the plugin through the command line instead of using them via Gradle.</p> <p>To publish the generated artifacts, the platforms use the Maven publish plugin, a Gradle plugin that provides the ability to publish build artifacts to Apache Maven repositories. The artifacts are published to artifacts.itemis.cloud which is a so-called nexus repository and the Apache Maven registry of the corresponding GitHub project (example).</p> <p>To run the build and execute the tests, two different tools can be used: for smaller repositories GitHub Actions are used. They can be configured through the Actions tab in the corresponding repository (example) and are saved in the .github/workflows directory of the repository.</p> <p>Bigger repositories use the TeamCity server located at build.mbeddr.com. TeamCity is a build management and continuous integration server. When a new branch is pushed to any of the mentioned repositories, a build is triggered and the tests are executed. Some projects require a code review and a successful build before a branch can be merged. Build configurations for the different projects are saved on the server. The actual build is executed by a build agent. The TeamCity server and the agents (which are sometimes not located on the same server) are run inside Docker containers. The source for the agent docker image is located at mbeddr/mbeddr.build.docker.</p>"},{"location":"platform_essentials/interpreter/","title":"Interpreter, coverage and tracing","text":"<p>The interpreter let you interpret code on the fly.

Make sure to set the the solution kind to <code>Other</code> in the module properties.</p> <p></p> <p>Now create a new model inside your new solution, create the new interpreter and give it a name. The category should be <code>arithmetic</code> so that other interpreters of this category can also use this interpreter, but you can also use other categories. A demo Java interpreter exists in mpsutils (mbeddr) that uses its own category <code>java</code>. You don\u2019t have to set the evaluated languages: they are automatically calculated based on the declared evaluators.</p> <p>In the related interpreter section, you can define that the current interpret should run before or after another interpreter. An example from KernelF: the collections operations should be interpreted first because they are reduced to simpler statements. The lambda and base interpreter should be run afterwards.</p> <p>The type mappings section can declare mappings from types that implement the IType interface to either a java type or another custom type that implements the IType interface.</p> <p></p> <p>An evaluator consists of a left and right side: the left side is a concept that should be interpreted. In the inspector, you can set cacheValues to true to enabling caching. When the same value is accessed again, the cached value is returned instead of recalculation a value. The interpreter cache can be disabled by unchecking Tools \u2192 Enable Interpreter Cache in the main menu.</p> <p></p> <p>The right side contains is an expression or a block and must return a value. The node expression refers to the current evaluated expression. A few expressions start with #, that are explained in their corresponding short descriptions. The #-&gt; expression is used to call functions (search for usages globally). The right side can return a Java object (including null) or call another interpreter with one of the #-expressions. Another interesting expressions is the env expression. It\u2019s an array that can be used to save values for other evaluators. The key must be a node. If you don\u2019t have a node available, you can also use a helper class with static dummy nodes as keys. An example could be a dot expression where the operation needs to access the operand e.g. <code>\"hello\".startswith(\"he\")</code>. <code>startswith()</code> is the operation, <code>\"hello\"</code> is the operand:</p> <p></p> <p>When the current interpreter is not suitable for interpreting the current node, the expression tryOtherInterpreter can be used to use the next interpreter to interpret the current node:</p> <p></p> <p>The castUp expression can be used to case a Java (baselanguage) expression to a type. For example, if the expression is of type Number (numberInput) and the target type is float, <code>numberInput.floatValue()</code> would be called. The $ expression returns the concept\u2019s type. It can be used for type mappings but also for child type constraints that can be entered in the middle of evaluators. For example: the evaluator of a modulo operator might require that the left and right expressions are of type integer otherwise the evaluator shouldn\u2019t be used:</p> <p></p> <p>The context expression can be used to access the interpreter configurations, the cache, the root interpreter and contains some other useful. It can, for example, be used to access the environment from a Java class by executing a method with the context as a parameter. Then the environment can be accessed by calling <code>context.getEnvironment()</code>. The environment can be nested by calling <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code>. The topmost environment in the stack is used.

The MPS team at itemis is a good environment for doing this. However, we have written a lof of stuff over time. And to increase overall efficiency and to be respectful of the time of the team members, it is recommended to read a few things in advance/in parallel. In this document we describe a list of recommended readings.</p> <p>I suggest you start with the book on DSL Engineering. It\u2019s available as a free PDF from voelter.de/books.</p> <p>In the first part, it discusses some general characterizations of DSLs. Part two is on language design; you should become proficient in the design concerns discussed there. Part three is about language implementation with different tools; you can skip the non-MPS parts, if you want to. The MPS-specific explanations are not up-to-date, but the concepts and approaches explained are still relevant.</p> <p>One recent extension to MPS we use all the time now is grammar cells, a way to more easily build usable editors for textual notation. We strongly suggest reading this paper: GrammarCells.</p> <p>Next, you may want to take a look at the MPS books by Fabien Campagne. They are essentially a beginner\u2019s guide to language development with MPS. Whenever you want to do something specific, then looking at how to do it in those books is a good starting point for deeper discussions with the colleagues (note: the official documentation might be a better starting point because these book might be outdated in some aspects.)</p> <p>The documentation page also contains videos and tutorials on a variety of specific MPS-related topics.</p> <p>Over the years we have built a lot of useful extensions and utilities to MPS. They are described on the  mbeddr platform page. Most of those are not documented, but you can find examples for all (relevant and stable) utilities in mbeddr itself.</p> <p>Finally, to understand the experiences we have made with MPS over the years, you may want to read this draft paper: Lessons Learned from Developing mbeddr.</p>","tags":["reference"]},{"location":"reference/reading_list/#working-on-extending-mbeddr","title":"Working on (extending) mbeddr","text":"<p>If, besides working with MPS in general, you plan to work on the mbeddr languages, more material should be read.
